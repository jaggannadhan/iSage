The purpose of this study was to investigate the time course of the changes of muscle-tendon mechanical properties and the function responses of the plantar flexor muscles following 5 × 60 s of static stretching. Fourteen healthy volunteers were tested on four separate days in a random order with three different rest times (0, 5, 10 min) after 5 × 60 s of stretching or following a control period without stretching. During each test, the dorsiflexion range of motion(RoM), passive resistive torque (PRT), and maximum voluntary contraction (MVC) were measured with a dynamometer.

Ultrasonography of the gastrocnemius medialis (GM) muscle-tendon junction displacement and motion capture allowed us to determine the length changes in the tendon and muscle, respectively, and hence to calculate their stiffness. We observed an increase in RoM and decrease in MVC at 0, 5, and 10 min post-stretching. This could be attributed to an increase in muscle elongation which lasted at least 10 min. A decrease in muscle-tendon stiffness was observed immediately, but not 5 or 10 min after the stretching. A decrease in PRT and muscle stiffness was observed up to 5 min after the stretching. No changes were detected in tendon stiffness or in any variable in the control group.

The effects of a 5 × 60 s static stretching exercise changes the muscle-tendon functions (RoM, MVC), which are related to mechanical changes of the muscle but not the tendon structure, respectively. Although the functional changes last for at least10 min, changes in muscle stiffness were only observed up to 5 min after the stretching exercise.

Stretching is generally divided into static, ballistic, and proprioceptive neuromuscular facilitation (PNF) stretching, and is commonly used in sports as a warm-up routine. With regard to static stretching, the increased range of motion (RoM) following a single stretching exercise goes along with a decrease in overall muscle-tendon stiffness and passive resistive torque (PRT). Distinguishing between muscular and tendon structures of the muscle-tendon unit (MTU), there have been conflicting reports about the effects of acute static stretching.These controversial results could be explained by the different stretching durations or intensities applied. While shorter stretch durations and lower stretch intensities are related to changes in muscle structure only, tendon structure seems to be only affected following longer stretch durations (>10 min) and/or greater stretch intensities(e.g. including maximum active contractions).

Similarly, stretch duration has also been reported to be related to the effects on performance. Kay and Blaze vich ( 2012) showed in their review that only static stretching interventions that lasted longer than 60 s might have a disadvantageous effect on maximum performance output. However, until now, it is not clear how long a possible decrease in performance will last.

Mizuno and co-workers reported that an increase in RoM following a 5-min static stretch will last between 30 and 60 min (Mizuno, Matsumoto, & Umemura, 2013b). However, the decrease in muscle-tendon stiffness seems to recover within 5 min (Mizuno, Matsumoto, & Umemura, 2013a). This decrease in muscle-tendon stiffness was associated with an increased displacement of the muscle-tendon junction (an indication of increased muscle belly length) up to 5 min after stretching at 15° of dorsiflexion only (not at 5° or 10°). 

This was in accordance with the results of Kay and Blazevich (2009), who reported a decrease in muscle stiffness immediately after 3 min of stretching, which recovered 30 min after the stretching. Responses up to 30 min after the stretching were not investigated. However, to the best of the authors’ knowledge, the precise time course of the response of muscle and tendon properties (e.g. passive muscle and tendon stiffness, active tendon stiffness) and function responses (e.g. RoM, maximum voluntary contraction (MVC)) within the first 10 min after stretching is not yet known.

Therefore, the objective of this study was to analyze the time course (immediately, 5, and 10 min after stretching) of the properties and function responses of the plantar flexor muscle-tendon system following a 5-min stretching exercise. We hypothesized an increase in RoM and a decrease in PRT and MVC, immediately, 5, and 10 min after stretching. We further assumed that these changes would be accompanied by a decrease in muscle and tendon stiffness and that these changes would last for 5 min, but would have recovered 10 min after the stretching.

On the first day subjects were familiarized with the lab equipment, with all assessments (RoM, passive, active), and the stretching regime. Moreover, Participants visited the laboratory for further four sessions on different days (with a 2 –7 days break in between) at the same time of day in order to assess the effects of stretching immediately (0min_post), 5 min (5min_post), and 10 min (10min_post) after the stretching, as well as in a control (C) condition without stretching, in a randomized order. 

Seven healthy female and seven healthy male volunteers with no history of lower leg injuries participated in this study. Subjects were informed about the testing procedure, but were naive of the study ’s aim and hypotheses. The study was approved by the local research ethics board and written informed consent was obtained from all volunteers before the onset of the experimental procedures. 

The temperature in the laboratory was kept constant at around 20.5°C. Measurements were performed without any warm-up and in the following order: pre-tests: RoM (1-min rest), PRT (1-min rest), MVC (1-min rest); intervention: stretching for 5 × 60 s; post-tests: immediately following stretching, or following 5 min of rest, or following 10 min of rest in the same order (RoM (1-min rest), PRT (1-min rest), MVC). In the control trial, the post-tests were performed without a prior stretch, 10 min after the pre-tests.
Participants were directed to regulate the motor of the dynamometer with a remote control until a maximum tolerable stretch was reached. The angular velocity of the dynamometer during this procedure was set to 5°/s. The difference between neutral position and the maximum dorsiflexion was defined as the dorsiflexion Range of Motion (RoM).

Passive resistive torque (PRT) was measured while the dynamometer moved the ankle joint from a 20° plantar flexion to the individual end dorsiflexion RoM. The dynamometer velocity was set to 5°/s to exclude any reflexive muscle activity. PRTs before and after the intervention were compared at the same angle of stretch to assess tissue resistance. 
Maximum voluntary contraction (MVC) measurement was performed with the dynamometer at an ankle position of 10° of plantar flexion. Participants were instructed to perform two isometric MVCs of the plantar flexors for 5 s, with rest periods of at least 1 min between the measurements.

Electromyography (EMG) was used to monitor muscular activity during PRT and MVC measurements. The raw EMG was monitored online during the RoM and PRT measurements, to ensure that the subject was relaxed.
Measurement of elongation of the muscle-tendon structures was done using a real-time ultrasound apparatus. During the RoM, PRT, and MVC measurements, the ultrasound probe was placed on the distal end of the Gastrocnemius muscle (GM), where the muscle merges into the Achilles tendon. 

Tendon and muscle lengths were analyzed during the PRT and MVC assessments, using a combination of ultrasound and 3D kinematics. Reflective markers were placed on the calcaneus, on the ultrasound probe, and on the medial epicondyle of the femur. The tendon length was calculated as the distance.Text: between Marker A (= insertion of Achilles tendon)
and Marker B plus the distance from Marker B to
the muscle-tendon junction (measured with ultra-sound). Moreover, muscle length was calculated as
the distance between Marker C (= origin of GM)
and Marker B minus the distance from Marker B to the muscle-tendon junction. Tendon and muscle
lengths were assessed at the end RoM of the pre
and post assessment, respectively.

Calculation of muscle/tendon force, passive muscle/tendon
stiffness, active tendon stiffness, and muscle-tendon stiff-ness. The muscle force of the GM was estimated by
multiplying the measured torque by the relative con-tribution of the physiological cross-sectional area(18%) of the GM within the plantar flexor muscles
and dividing by the moment arm of the triceps surae muscle, which was individually measured by tape measure as the distance between the malleolus lateralis and the Achilles tendon at rest at neutral ankle position. The mean value of the moment arm was 4.4 cm, with a range of 3.5 – 5.0 cm. Active tendon stiffness was calculated as the change in the active force divided by the change of the related tendon length during the MVC measurements over a range of force of 50 –90% of MVC at 10° plantar flexion. Passive tendon stiffness, muscle stiffness, and muscle-tendon stiff-ness were calculated as the change in passive force produced at the last 10° up to maximum dorsiflexion divided by the change of the related tendon length, muscle length, and joint angle, respectively. 

Stretching exercise
The stretching exercise was undertaken with the dynamometer, with the starting point at neutral ankle position (90°). The subjects were asked to regulate the motor of the dynamometer with a remote control and a maximum angular velocity of 5°/s to get into a dorsiflexion (stretching) position corresponding to the end RoM, with the help of visual feedback. This position was held for 60 s. This procedure was repeated four times, resulting in a total stretch period of 300 s. Between the stretches, the dynamometer moved the ankle into neutral position and back again into the stretching position at 5°/s. The breaks in between the stretches lasted around 20 s. Subjects were asked to be fully relaxed during the stretching exercise.

Statistical analyses

SPSS (version 20.0) was used for all the statistical analyses. To determine the inter-rater reliability of the muscle-tendon displacement measurements, intraclass correlation coefficients (ICCs) were used. A Shapiro-Wilk test was used to verify the normal distribution of all the variables. To confirm homogeneity of the baseline characteristics of all four groups, a one-way repeated-measures ANOVA test (normally distributed data) or a Friedman test (other data) was performed.Subsequently, if the data were normally distributed, we performed a two-way repeated-measures ANOVA test (factors: time [pre vs. post] and rest duration [0min_post, 5min_post, 10min_post, C]). Otherwise, we performed a Friedman test to test for differences between the conditions. If the ANOVA or Friedman test was significant, we performed a t-test or a Wilcoxon test to identify the location of the significant differences. An alpha level of P= 0.05 was defined for the statistical significance of all the tests.

The mean ICCs of the inter-rater tests of the ultrasound video analysis were 0.98, 0.98, and 0.97 for the muscle-tendon junction displacement during the RoM, PRT, and MVC measurements, respectively.

There was a significant overall effect in RoM seen in the Friedman test ( P< 0.01; χ2= 32.25) and a significant time effect in muscle elongation seen in the ANOVA test ( P= 0.01, F= 10.2, η2= 0.48). No group effect ( P= 0.35, F= 1.2, η2= 0.29) or interaction effect ( P= 0.30, F= 1.3, η2= 0.30) was observed in muscle elongation. The pairwise comparison showed a significant increase in RoM, immediately, 5, and 10 min after the stretching. Moreover, the muscle was significantly elongated at the end RoM when comparing pre- and post-measurements (5min_post + 12.1%; 10min_post +20.0%). There were small (but insignificant) changes in tendon elongation (5min_post + 2.4%; 10min_post −11.4%). No changes were detected in the control condition.

The ANOVA test showed a significant time effect for PRT ( P= 0.02, F= 10.1, η2= 0.59; with no group effect P= 0.88, F= 0.2, η2= 0.11; or interaction effect P= 0.39, F=1 . 2 , η2= 0.42), muscle-tendon stiffness ( P= 0.03, F= 8.15, η2= 0.54; with no group effect P= 0.76, F= 0.39, η2= 0.19; or interaction effect P= 0.43, F= 1.1, η2= 0.39), and muscle stiffness ( P= 0.03; F= 7.97, η2= 0.53; with no group effect P= 0.95, F= 0.1, η2= 0.06; or interaction effect P= 0.48, F=0 . 9 , η2= 0.37).

The ANOVA test also showed a significant time effect in MVC ( P< 0.01, F= 13.93, η2= 0.52; with a significant group effect P< 0.01, F= 7.5, η2=0.67; but no interaction effect P= 0.1, F= 2.7, η2=0.42). The pairwise comparison revealed that there was a significant decrease in MVC, immediately, 5, and 10 min after the stretching. No changes were detected in active tendon stiffness or in the control condition.Discussion
The purpose of this study was to investigate the time course (immediately after stretching = 0min_post, 5 min after stretching = 5min_post, and 10 min afterstretching = 10min_post) of possible changes of the MTU function and mechanical properties of the plantar flexor muscles following a 5 × 60 s stretching exercise. As expected, we found an increase in RoM and a decrease in MVC in the three intervention groups, which lasted for at least 10 min. Moreover, muscle stiffness decreased but returned to baseline values between 5 and 10 min after the stretching. No effects were found on the tendon tissue properties at any instant following the stretching.

Similar to previous studies of a single static stretching exercise (Kato et al., 2010; Konrad, Budini, et al.,2017; Konrad, Stafilidis, et al., 2017), RoM was found to be increased in the present study immediately after the stretching. The increase in RoM after a 5-min and10-min break following stretching is in accordance with the study of Mizuno et al. ( 2013b ), who reported that the retention time of the RoM following a 5-min stretching exercise is between 30 and 60 min. In contrast, Ryan et al. ( 2008b ) found that RoM returned to baseline after 10 min, following 2, 4, and 8 min of stretching. A possible explanation for why the RoM returned to baseline faster than in the study of Mizuno et al. ( 2013b ) and the present study might be the duration of the single stretching bouts. While Ryan et al. (2008) stretched in 30 s bouts (i.e. 4×,8×, and 16× for 30 s for the 2, 4, and 8-min protocols, respectively), subjects in the study of Mizuno et al. (2013b ) and the present study stretched for 60 s per stretching bout (5 × 60 s). Although the overall stretching time was the same in the different studies, the increased number of breaks between the single stretching bouts could have led to a decrease in stretching intensity (i.e. Freitas et al., 2015).PRT was decreased immediately after 5 × 60 s of static stretching, which is in agreement with several previous studies. This is also in accordance with the results obtained by Kay and Blazevich, who reported a decrease in passive joint torque immediately after the stretching, which was recovered after 30 min. The design of the present study allowed us to specify that the recovery of the decrease in PRT occurred between 5 and 10 min after the stretching. Concerning overall muscle-tendon stiffness, we observed a significant decrease immediately after the stretching, but only a tendency of a decrease at 5 min and 10 min post-stretching. Decreased muscle-tendon stiffness between 10 and 20 min after 4 and 8 min of stretching was shown by Ryan et al. 

The discrepancies between the study of Ryan et al. and our study might be explained by the different stretching intensities used. We performed a protocol with constant joint angle during the stretching, which was probably accompanied by decreasing torque. Previous studies have shown that constant-torque stretching leads to a greater decrease in muscle-tendon stiffness than constant-angle stretching. A further explanation for these differences might be found in the different methods used. We undertook the post-stretching measurements on separate days. We believe that such repeated stretches during the test session might affect muscle-tendon stiffness, in a similar way to the intervention.

Concerning maximal isometric contraction movements following a single static stretching exercise, several studies have reported no detrimental effect on maximum performance; however, others have showed decreased performance following a single static stretching exercise. These controversial results could possibly be explained by the differences in overall stretch duration. Reid et al. demonstrated that an additional aerobic activity (dynamic activity and dynamic stretching) to a static stretching exercise up to 60 s even can have a beneficial effect on maximum performance, while 120 s of static stretching lead to a decrease in performance. As expected, the 5 × 60 s of stretching applied in the present study resulted in a detrimental effect on maximum isometric torque (MVC) immediately after the stretching. In addition, we observed that the recovery time of the MVC is more than 10 min, after 5 × 60 s of static stretching. Therefore, we would not recommend such a large load of static stretching before a competition or training where maximum force is essential.

We also investigated the effect of 5 × 60 s of stretching on the muscle and tendon structure separately. The parameters assessed were muscle- and tendon extensibility, muscle stiffness, passive tendon stiffness, and active tendon stiffness. As reported in previous studies, we observed a decrease in muscle stiffness, but not in tendon stiffness, following a single static stretching exercise. However, others have reported a decrease in tendon stiffness with no changes in muscle stiffness following a single static stretch. Possible reasons for these controversial results might be found in the different stretch durations. According to the results of the present study, decreased muscle stiffness returned to baseline between 5 and 10 min. This is in accordance, to some extent, with the studies of Mizuno et al. and Kay and Blazevich. Mizuno et al. found a larger displacement of the muscle-tendon junction at 15° dorsiflexion angle after 5-min rest following a 5-min stretch. However, this effect vanished 10 min after the stretching. Similarly, Kay and Blazevich reported decreased muscle stiffness immediately, but not after 30-min rest, following a 3-min stretch.The stretching (e.g. by lengthening titin), these results could be an effect of the restored sarcomere lengths between 5 and 10 min after the stretching. An increase in sarcomere length could also explain the decrease in MVC. Interestingly, MVC was still reduced 10 min after stretching, although muscle stiffness apparently returned to baseline values. However, a closer look at the data 10 min after stretching revealed a tendency of reduced muscle stiffness indicating that reduced muscle stiffness might be related to reduced MVC. 

A further possible mechanism which explains functional changes (increased RoM and decreased MVC 10 min after the stretching) and the absence of mechanical changes (i.e. muscle stiffness) might be an increased stretch tolerance and perception of pain. Our data support this hypothesis since PRT at the end RoM (pre and post) was significantly increased at all three timepoints.

Since we measured muscle and tendon stiffness with force-elongation curves we might have neglected other possible mechanism which are responsible for mechanical changes like synergist muscles, joint capsules, nerves, skin, and fasciae. Furthermore, the seated position during the experiments might have stretched the sciatic nerve during the static stretching exercise and therefore affected the RoM. Thus, changes in sciatic nerve might also explain the changes in the function and the absence of changes in the measured mechanical parameters.

We conclude that a single static stretching exercise over 5 × 60 s increases the RoM and decreases MVC for at least 10 min. However, these changes can only be partially explained by more compliant muscle tissue within the first 5 min after the stretching. Hence, increased RoM and decreased MVC might additionally be associated with increased stretch tolerance and changes in the sciatic nerve.
