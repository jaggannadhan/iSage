The agency manages a wide array of functions, including the processing of applications for immigration benefits, such as employment-based classifications, work authorizations, and travel documents.

USCIS plays a critical role in administering the Optional Practical Training (OPT) program specifically designed for F-1 students, allowing them to gain practical experience in their field of study. In addition to overseeing the OPT program, USCIS processes Employment Authorization Documents (EADs) and evaluates various applications that support noncitizen entrepreneurs, including programs related to the International Entrepreneur Rule and employment-based visas like the EB-1.

Furthermore, USCIS provides guidance and regulations for individuals wishing to immigrate to the United States and ensures the integrity of the immigration system by upholding laws and policies. The agency also evaluates petitions for waivers and requests for deferred action. By managing the complexities of immigration applications and facilitating pathways for foreign workers, USCIS plays a vital role in shaping the landscape of immigration and naturalization in the United States.</data>

<node id="&quot;FORM I-765&quot;">
  <data key="d0">"EVENT"</data>
  <data key="d1">Form I-765 is an essential application for employment authorization utilized by various categories of noncitizens in the United States, enabling them to legally work while their immigration status is being resolved. It serves as the primary form to request an Employment Authorization Document (EAD), which is crucial for individuals seeking the right to work in the U.S. 

Specifically, Form I-765 is necessary for M-1 students and F-1 students during their Optional Practical Training (OPT) period, as they are required to submit this application to the U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) to obtain work authorization. F-1 students can file Form I-765 for both pre-completion and post-completion OPT, making it vital for their employment opportunities.

In addition to students, Form I-765 is also applicable to noncitizen spouses of individuals who have been paroled under the International Entrepreneur Rule. These spouses can file for employment authorization after being paroled into the United States, which is necessary for their legal employment as well.

Overall, Form I-765 plays a critical role for various noncitizens, including F-1 and M-1 students, asylum seekers, J-2 dependents, and those filing for Temporary Protected Status (TPS) renewal or deferred action. By filing this application, eligible individuals can navigate their immigration processes while seeking employment in the United States.</data>
