See section 214(l) of the Immigration Nationality Act (INA). The program addresses the shortage of qualified doctors in medically underserved areas.\n\nEligibility\nAlthough each state has developed its own application rules and guidelines, the following program requirements apply to all J-1 foreign medical graduates.\n\nThe J-1 foreign medical graduate must:\n1. Have been admitted to the United States under section 101(a)(15)(J) of the INA to receive graduate medical training;\n2. Enter into a bona fide, full-time employment contract to practice medicine in H-1B nonimmigrant status for at least 3 years at a health care facility located in an area designated by U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) as a Health Professional Shortage Area (HPSA), Medically Underserved Area (MUA), or Medically Underserved Population (MUP) or serving patients who reside in a HPSA, MUA, or MUP.\n3. Obtain a “no objection” statement in writing from their home country if they are contractually obligated to return to their home country upon completion of the exchange program.\n4. Agree to begin employment at the health care facility, specified in the waiver application, within 90 days of receipt of the waiver, not the date their J-1 visa expires.\n\nSee each state’s public health department (or its equivalent) website for specific details.\n\n\nApplication Process\nTo apply for a waiver, a J-1 foreign medical graduate must:\n1. Obtain the sponsorship of a state health department, or its equivalent.\n2. Complete the U.S. Department of State (DOS) Form DS-3035, J-1 Visa Waiver Review Application.\n\nThe state public health department, or its equivalent, that agreed to sponsor the J-1 foreign medical graduate for a waiver must then send the waiver application to the DOS Waiver Review Division (DOS-WRD) for a recommendation.\nFor more information regarding DOS filing procedures and documentation requirements, please see Department of State J Visa Waiver (https://j1visawaiverrecommendation.state.gov/).\n\n\nAfter DOS Makes a Recommendation\nDOS-WRD will notify USCIS electronically of its recommendation. DOS will notify the J-1 foreign medical graduate, attorney of record (if applicable), and the state agency that requested the waiver by mail.\nUSCIS will make a final determination on whether to approve the waiver application. Upon a favorable recommendation by DOS-WRD, USCIS will generally grant the waiver as long as there are no underlying concerns. USCIS will provide written notice of its decision to the J-1 foreign medical graduate and their representative (if applicable).\nIf DOS-WRD recommends the waiver:\n1. The petitioner must submit Form I-129, Petition for a Nonimmigrant Worker (https://www.uscis.gov/i-129), along with the DOS-WRD favorable recommendation letter, in order to request a change of the J-1 foreign medical graduate’s nonimmigrant status to H-1B.\n2. The spouse and/or child of the waiver recipient must submit Form I-539, Application to Extend/Change Nonimmigrant Status (https://www.uscis.gov/i-539), in order to change status from J-2 to H-4 nonimmigrant status.\n3. The J-1 foreign medical graduate must practice medicine for at least 3 years in an area designated by HHS as a HPSA, MUA, or MUP, or, in some cases, serve patients in such an area.\n\nOnce the Conrad 30 waiver recipient has fulfilled all terms and conditions imposed on the waiver, including the 3-year period of employment with the health care facility under their approved contract, they (and their spouse and/or child) will become eligible to apply for:\n1. An immigrant visa\n2. Adjustment of status\n3. An H or L nonimmigrant visa\n\nIf the waiver recipient fails to fulfill the terms and conditions imposed on the waiver, they (and their spouse and/or child) will once again become subject to the 2-year foreign residence requirement under section 212(e) of the INA.\n\n\n\nFrequently Asked Questions\n\nQ1. Does a J-1 foreign medical graduate need to file Form I-612, Application for Waiver of the Foreign Residence Requirement, in order to apply for a Conrad 30 Waiver?\nA1. No, the Form I-612 is not required.\n\nQ.2 The law requires the recipient of a Conrad 30 waiver to work full-time for three continuous years. What is the definition of “full-time” work?\nA2. DOS considers “full-time” employment to be 40 hours per week.\n\nQ3. If a J-1 foreign medical graduate is granted a Conrad 30 waiver and H-1B status, may he or she change employers if the original health care facility closes?\nA3. Depending on the circumstances, USCIS may consider the closure of the health care facility named in the waiver application an extenuating circumstance excusing early termination of employment. A J-1 foreign medical graduate who is granted a Conrad 30 waiver and H-1B status must comply with the terms and conditions of that nonimmigrant status. USCIS may, however excuse early termination of the 3-year period of employment with the health care facility named in the Conrad 30 waiver application and H-1B petition due to extenuating circumstances. Examples of extenuating circumstances include closure of the health care",

A J-1 foreign medical graduate who is granted a Conrad 30 waiver and H-1B status must comply with the terms and conditions of that nonimmigrant status. USCIS may, however excuse early termination of the 3-year period of employment with the health care facility named in the Conrad 30 waiver application and H-1B petition due to extenuating circumstances. Examples of extenuating circumstances include closure of the health care facility or hardship to the noncitizen. In determining whether to excuse such early termination of employment, USCIS will base its decision on the specific facts of each case. In all cases, the burden to establish eligibility for a favorable exercise of discretion rests with the H-1B foreign medical graduate.\nAnother health care facility may seek to employ such a waiver recipient (before the time the recipient has completed his or her 3-year contract named in the waiver application and the original H-1B petition) by filing a new H-1B petition with USCIS. See 8 CFR 214.2(h)(2)(i)(D) and (E). Although the state public health department does not need to file a new waiver application with DOS, the new H-1B petition must be accompanied by the documentary evidence generally required under 8 CFR 214.2(h), including:\n1. An explanation from the waiver recipient, with supporting evidence, establishing that extenuating circumstances necessitate a change of employment\n2. Evidence that the geographic area or areas of intended employment have been designated by HHS as a HPSA, MUA, or MUP, or in some cases, that the waiver recipient will be serving patients in such an area.\n\nThe new H-1B petition will not be approved unless USCIS determines that the waiver recipient has established the existence of extenuating circumstances that excuse early termination of employment as stated in the terms and conditions in the original H-1B petition.\n\n\nQ4. Can the recipient of a Conrad waiver who is in H-1B status begin employment at a new health care facility after the extenuating circumstances H-1B petition is filed and while it is pending?\nA4. Yes. The waiver recipient may begin employment with the new employer after the new H-1B petition is filed and while it is pending. However, if the new petition is denied, employment authorization will cease and the waiver recipient will become subject to the 2-year foreign residence requirement under section 212(e) of the INA unless they are the beneficiary of another H1-B petition with current validity dates for employment at a qualifying healthcare facility.\n\nQ5. What are the reporting requirements for the health care facility named in the waiver application and H-1B petition if the waiver recipient fails to fulfill the 3-year employment contract, or if he or she changes employers?\nA5. If the health care facility no longer employs the waiver recipient, the health care facility must immediately send a letter explaining the changes in the terms and conditions of employment of the waiver recipient to the Service Center that approved the I-129 petition, as is required, under 8 CFR 214.2(h)(11)(i)(A).\n\nQ6. Can the spouse and/or child of a waiver recipient who has not yet fulfilled the terms and conditions of the Conrad 30 waiver independently apply for waiver of the 2-year foreign residence requirement?\nA6. According to the DOS website (https://www.state.gov/), the spouse and/or child of a waiver recipient can independently apply for a waiver only if the principal waiver recipient has died, the spouse has divorced the principal waiver recipient, or if the child is over age 21. Note that if the J-2 spouse/child was also a J-1 at some point in the past, they may, if qualified, seek a waiver for themselves, independent of their spouse/parent.\n\nQ7. How does a Conrad 30 waiver recipient (or some other concerned individual) report wage and labor related abuse?\nA7. The Department of Labor’s Wage and Hour Division (WHD) is responsible for enforcing worker protections in certain temporary worker programs including the H-1B program. For information pertaining to how you can report wage and labor related abuse, please see Department of Labor’s WHD webpage (https://www.dol.gov/agencies/whd/contact).\n\n\n\nBackground on J-1 medical status\nA J-1 exchange visitor who came to the United States or acquired such status in order to receive graduate medical education or training (a J-1 foreign medical graduate) is generally ineligible to apply for:\n1. An immigrant visa\n2. Adjustment of Status\n3. An H or L nonimmigrant visa\n\nTo be eligible to do so, a J-1 exchange visitor must have resided and been physically present in his or her country of nationality or last residence for at least 2 years (the 2-year foreign residence requirement) upon completion of the J-1 exchange visitor program. Any spouse or child admitted as an accompanying J-2 status holder is also subject to the 2-year foreign residence requirement. See section 212(e) of the INA.\nA J-1 foreign medical graduate (and his or her J-2 spouse and/or child) is ineligible to change from J nonimmigrant status to any other nonimmigrant status (except in certain cases to A, G, T, or U). See section 248(a)(2) of the INA.\n\n\nAdditional Resources\n\nOther USCIS Links\n1.

If you are not a citizen or a lawful permanent resident, you may need to prove that you can work in the United States by presenting an Employment Authorization Document (Form I-766/EAD) (https://www.uscis.gov/employment-authorization#). You may apply for an EAD if you are eligible.\n\nUSCIS issues the following types of EADs:\n1. Initial EAD: This document proves you are allowed to work in the United States.\n2. Renewal EAD: This document renews your initial EAD. Generally, you should not file for a renewal EAD more than 180 days before your original EAD expires.\n3. Replacement EAD: This document replaces a lost, stolen, or mutilated EAD. A replacement EAD also replaces an EAD that was issued with incorrect information, such as a misspelled name.\n\nNote: In addition, certain B-1 nonimmigrant visitors are issued EADs.\n\nForm I-765 Category\nForm I-765, Application for Employment Authorization (https://www.uscis.gov/i-765), asks for your eligibility category.

M-1 students may only engage in employment for purposes of practical training.[1]\n\nA. On-Campus Employment\nF-1 students may engage in on-campus employment subject to certain conditions and restrictions.[2] F-1 status permits students with Designated School Official (DSO) approval to work at an on-campus job for up to 20 hours per week when school is in session.[3] During vacation periods, students may work on-campus full-time.[4]\nEmployment may be performed at off-campus locations that are educationally affiliated with the school and the employment must be an integral part of the student’s educational program.[5] Students working on campus may be employed by the school itself or by any independent companies serving the school’s needs, such as the school bookstore or cafeteria suppliers providing food on campus premises. The employment must not displace U.S. residents.[6]\nAn F-1 student may be employed on-campus for duration of status, but may not begin more than 30 days before the start of classes.[7] F-1 students engaged in on-campus employment are not required to apply for employment authorization with USCIS.\n\nB. Off-Campus Employment\nUSCIS may authorize an F-1 student to work off campus on a part-time basis after having been in F-1 status for one full academic year if the student is in good academic standing as determined by the DSO.[8]\n\n1. Severe Economic Hardship\nUSCIS may authorize an eligible F-1 student to work off campus on a part-time basis if on-campus employment opportunities are not available or are otherwise insufficient. USCIS may also authorize an eligible F-1 student to work off campus on a part-time basis due to severe economic hardship caused by unforeseen circumstances beyond the student’s control.[9]\nSevere economic hardship may include a loss of financial aid or on-campus employment through no fault of the student; substantial fluctuations in the value of currency or exchange rate; inordinate increases in tuition or living costs; or unexpected changes in the financial condition of the student’s source of support, medical bills, or other substantial and unexpected expenses.[10]\nThe DSO must recommend the F-1 student for off-campus employment on the Certificate of Eligibility for Nonimmigrant Student Status (Form I-20) and the student must properly file an Application for Employment Authorization (Form I-765), and receive an employment authorization document (EAD, Form I-766) from USCIS before starting off-campus employment.\nUSCIS may grant severe economic hardship EADs in 1-year intervals, not to extend past the expected date of completion of the student’s current course of study.[11] Severe economic hardship EADs may be renewed while the student continues to maintain status and is in good academic standing.[12] Severe economic hardship employment authorization terminates when the student transfers from one school to another or when the need for employment ceases. If the student is maintaining status, beginning a new educational program at the same school does not terminate the student’s employment authorization.\n\n2. Severe Economic Hardship due to Emergent Circumstances (Special Student Relief)\nDHS may suspend certain regulatory requirements for F-1 students experiencing severe economic hardship as a direct result of emergent circumstances.[13] This suspension, also known as special student relief (SSR), first appeared in the Code of Federal Regulations in 1998.[14]\nEmergent circumstances are events that affect F-1 students from a particular region and create severe economic hardship. These events may include, but are not limited to, natural disasters, financial crises, and military conflicts.\nThe Secretary of Homeland Security may suspend duration of status, full course of study, and on-campus and off-campus employment regulatory requirements due to emergent circumstances. DHS designates SSR by publication of a Federal Register notice, which provides the start and end dates of the suspension of those requirements.\n\nLawful Status\nGenerally, DHS considers an F-1 student to be in lawful status if the student is pursuing a full course of study at an approved educational institution.[15] However, when DHS designates SSR by publication of a Federal Register notice, eligible students may reduce their full course of study as a result of accepting employment authorized by the Federal Register notice.\nDHS considers an F-1 student to be in lawful status during the period of authorized employment, subject to any other conditions specified in the notice, provided that for the duration of the authorized employment, the student is:\n\nRegistered for at least the minimum number of semester or quarter hours of instruction per academic term as specified in the Federal Register notice; and\nIs continuing to make normal progress toward completing the student’s course of study.\nWhen DHS designates SSR by publication of a Federal Register notice, the number of semester or quarter hours of instruction per academic term cannot be less than 6 semester or quarter hours if the student is at the undergraduate level or one half of the credit hours normally required under a full course of study if an undergraduate student is enrolled in a term of different duration. A student at the graduate level must remain registered in a minimum of 3 semester or quarter hours of instruction.[16]\n\nStudents enrolled in kindergarten through grade 12 at a private school or grades 9 through 12 at a public high school must maintain the minimum number of hours of class attendance per week prescribed by the academic institution for making normal progress toward graduation.[17]\n\nEligibility Criteria\nFor an F-1 student to be eligible for SSR, the DSO must certify in the Student and Exchange Visitor Information System (SEVIS) that the student:\n\nIs a citizen of a country specified in the Federal Register notice or, if such eligibility is specified in the SSR notice, a",

Documentation\n1. On-Campus Employment\nAn F-1 nonimmigrant student authorized by the student’s DSO to engage in on-campus employment by means of the Federal Register notice does not need to file an Application for Employment Authorization (Form I-765) with USCIS.[19]\n\nTo engage in on-campus employment more than 20 hours per week, consistent with a designation of SSR, the F-1 student must demonstrate to the DSO that the employment is necessary to avoid severe economic hardship resulting from the emergent circumstances, and the DSO must notate the student’s Form I-20 in accordance with the Federal Register notice.[20]\n\n2. Off-Campus Employment\nAn F-1 nonimmigrant student authorized by the student’s DSO to engage in off-campus employment must file a Form I-765 with USCIS and include a copy of a properly endorsed Form I-20 with the filing. An F-1 student must receive employment authorization and an EAD from USCIS before engaging in off-campus employment.[21]\n\nTo engage in off-campus employment more than 20 hours per week consistent with a designation of SSR, the F-1 student must demonstrate to the DSO that the employment is necessary to avoid severe economic hardship resulting from the emergent circumstances, and the DSO must notate the student’s Form I-20 in accordance with the Federal Register notice.[22]\n\nUSCIS may only grant off-campus employment authorization due to severe economic hardship for up to 1 year,[23] unless the Secretary of Homeland Security suspends the applicability of this requirement through publication of a Federal Register notice. If the 1-year limitation is suspended, USCIS may grant SSR employment authorization for the duration of the Federal Register notice validity period, but the period of authorization may not exceed the F-1 student’s academic program end date.\n\n3. Existing Employment Authorization\nIf an F-1 student already has off-campus employment authorization, they may benefit from SSR without applying for a new EAD. To benefit from SSR in this context, the F-1 student must request that the student’s DSO update the remarks field of the F-1 student’s Form I-20, in accordance with the Federal Register notice.\n\nAn F-1 student authorized by a DSO for on-campus employment does not need to apply for an EAD solely because of publication of a Federal Register notice if the F-1 student does not seek to engage in off-campus employment. If consistent with the Federal Register notice, the F-1 student may drop below what would otherwise be the minimum course load. In such a case, the F-1 student must request that the DSO update the remarks field of the F-1 student’s Form I-20, in accordance with the Federal Register notice.\n\nD. F-1 Student Sponsored by an International Organization\nAn F-1 student who has been offered employment by a recognized international organization[24] must apply for employment authorization from USCIS.\n\nA student seeking employment authorization under this provision is required to present a written certification from the international organization that the proposed employment is within the scope of the organization’s sponsorship; a Form I-20 with the employment page completed by the DSO certifying eligibility for employment; and a completed Form I-765 with the required fee.\n\nAn F-1 student must receive employment authorization and an EAD from USCIS before engaging in off-campus employment.\n\nFootnotes\n[^ 1] See Chapter 5, Practical Training, Section E, M-1 Practical Training (https://www.uscis.gov/policy-manual/volume-2-part-f-chapter-5#S-E).

They provide lawful permanent residence (Green Card), which can eventually lead to U.S. citizenship.\n\nThe lawful permanent resident process involves two or three steps, depending on the employment-based immigrant visa classification sought. In general, most petitioners (typically employers) filing EB-2 and EB-3 petitions must take the first step of filing an Application for Permanent Employment Certification (ETA Form 9089 (PDF)), commonly known as a labor certification, with the Department of Labor (DOL). An approved permanent labor certification application demonstrates that:\n1. The petitioner tested the labor market in the geographic area where the permanent job offer is located to establish that there are no able, qualified, and available U.S. workers who are willing to accept the permanent job offer; and\n2. The employment of the beneficiary will not adversely affect the wages and working conditions of similarly employed U.S. workers.\n\nAfter certification from DOL, the petitioner submits the certified labor certification with an immigrant visa petition to USCIS. In all cases, the process requires the two steps of filing of an immigrant petition with USCIS and either an adjustment application with USCIS (if you are in the United States) or an immigrant visa application with the Department of State (DOS) (if you are outside the United States or not pursuing adjustment of status).\n\nAn approved immigrant visa petition secures your priority date that will determine the order of immigrant visa availability. You may only file an adjustment application or request a visa through a consulate once an immigrant visa is immediately available. If an immigrant visa is immediately available when you or your sponsoring employer files the petition with USCIS, you may file your adjustment application at the same time. You are eligible to apply for work authorization concurrently with your adjustment application and while your adjustment application is pending.\n\nThe availability of an immigrant visa will depend on the employment-based classification being sought (typically the availability is greater for the higher preferences), and the immigrant’s country of chargeability (usually the country of birth).\n\nAs a general matter, EB-1 immigrant visas tend to be immediately available to any qualifying applicant, regardless of country of origin. For EB-2 and EB-3 immigrant visas, however, there is typically a queue for nationals of China and India.\n\nThe USCIS webpage Visa Availability and Priority Dates (https://www.uscis.gov/green-card/green-card-processes-and-procedures/visa-availability-and-priority-dates) and Consular Processing (https://www.uscis.gov/green-card/green-card-processes-and-procedures/consular-processing) provides information about the DOS Visa Bulletin (https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/legal/visa-law0/visa-bulletin.html) process and explain how DOS allocates immigrant visas and consular processing generally.\n\nEB-1A Extraordinary Ability\nPersons of extraordinary ability in the sciences, arts, education, business, or athletics may self-petition to enter the United States permanently to continue working in their area of extraordinary ability.\n\nYou may be eligible for the EB-1A extraordinary ability immigrant visa classification if you have extraordinary ability in the sciences, arts, education, business, or athletics as demonstrated by sustained national or international acclaim and recognized achievements in your field of expertise. In addition, you must show that you will continue working in your area of extraordinary ability. Extraordinary ability means that your level of expertise indicates that you are one of the small percentage of individuals who have risen to the very top of your field.\n\nDo I have the education, experience, or skills needed to qualify?\nYou must be able to establish that you have extraordinary ability in your field.\n\nThe EB-1A extraordinary ability classification is for people who are recognized as being at the very top of their field and who are coming to the United States to continue work in that field. To establish eligibility, you must demonstrate sustained national or international acclaim and that your achievements, including STEM achievements, have been recognized in your field by showing: (1) that you have received a major internationally recognized award, similar to a Nobel Prize; or, more commonly, (2) that you meet at least 3 of the 10 requirements listed below and all your evidence, when evaluated together, shows that you are among the small percentage of individuals that have risen to the very top of your field. If you have not received a major internationally recognized award, you must submit evidence that affirmatively answers at least 3 of the 10 questions below:\n1. Have you received any lesser nationally or internationally recognized prizes or awards for excellence in the field of endeavor?\n2. Are you, or have you been, a member of an association that requires outstanding achievements of its members as judged by recognized national or international experts?\n3. Is there published material in professional or major trade publications or major media about you that relates to your work in the field?\n4. Have you participated on a panel or individually as a judge of the work of others in the same or in an allied field of specialization?\n5. Have you made an original scientific, scholarly, or business-related contribution to the field that is of major significance?\n6. Have you authored any scholarly articles in professional journals or other major media?\n7. Has your work been displayed at an artistic exhibition or showcase?\n8. Have you played a leading or critical role for an organization with a distinguished reputation?\n9.

However, there is no comparable evidence for the one-time achievement of a major, internationally recognized award.\n\nIf you meet these minimum threshold requirements, USCIS will then evaluate all the evidence you submitted in its totality to determine whether you have sustained national or international acclaim and recognized achievements in your field of expertise and that you are one of the small percentage of individuals who have risen to the very top of your field.\n\nThe USCIS Policy Manual includes detailed guidance regarding how EB-1A eligibility is evaluated (https://www.uscis.gov/policy-manual/volume-6-part-f-chapter-2), including a discussion of considerations that are relevant to evaluating evidence under each of the above criteria and evaluating comparable evidence.\n\nDo I need to have a job offer?

You may submit the petition yourself directly to USCIS, or a company may file a petition on your behalf.\n\nSome of the evidence typically submitted to demonstrate that a person is coming to the United States to continue to work in your area of extraordinary ability includes:\n1. Letters from current or prospective employers,\n2. Documents evidencing your prearranged commitments (such as contracts), or\n3. A statement detailing your plans on how you intend to continue working in your field in the United States.\n\nWill I be working in the United States on a permanent (no time limit) basis as a lawful permanent resident or will I be working on a temporary basis as a nonimmigrant for a specified period of time?\nYou will be working in the United States on a permanent basis if you are granted lawful permanent resident status.\n\n\nEB-1B Outstanding Professors and Researchers\nProfessors and researchers who are internationally recognized as outstanding may be eligible to come to the United States permanently to work for an institution of higher education or private employer when the prospective employer files a petition on their behalf.\n\nYou may be eligible for EB-1B classification as an outstanding professor or researcher if you are internationally recognized for your outstanding achievements in a particular academic field. You must have at least 3 years of experience in teaching or research in that academic area. You must also be entering the United States to pursue a tenure or tenure-track teaching or comparable research position at a university, institution of higher education, or private employer.\n\nDo I have the education, experience, or skills needed to qualify?\nYou must be able to establish that you are recognized internationally as outstanding in the academic field specified in the petition.\n\nTo establish eligibility for an EB-1B visa, your sponsoring employer must submit documentation that you have at least 3 years of experience in teaching or research in the academic field. The 3 years of experience may include teaching or research while pursuing your advanced degree if you received that degree and, for teaching, if you had full responsibility for the class or the research was recognized within the academic field as outstanding. You must also submit evidence that affirmatively answers at least 2 of the 6 questions below:\n1. Have you received a major prize or award for outstanding achievement?\n2. Are you, or have you been, a member of an association that requires outstanding achievements of its members?\n3. Is there published material in professional publications about your work in the academic field?\n4. Have you participated on a panel or individually as a judge of the work of others in the same or in an allied academic field?\n5.

Do I need a company to submit a petition for me?\nYou must have a job offer from a United States employer that is a university, institution of higher learning, or private employer that employs at least 3 persons full-time in research positions. That same employer must file a petition for you, but because no labor certification is required, the employer does not have to apply through the Department of Labor before filing with USCIS. The job offer must be in the form of a letter that offers you a tenure or tenure track position or a permanent research position.\n\nWill I be working in the United States on a permanent (no time limit) basis as a lawful permanent resident or will I be working on a temporary basis as a nonimmigrant for a specified period of time?\nYou will be working in the United States on a permanent basis if you are granted lawful permanent resident status.\n\n\n\nEB-1C Multinational Managers and Executives\nCertain managers and executives with experience working abroad for",

While you need a sponsoring employer, because no labor certification is required, the employer does not have to apply through the Department of Labor before filing with USCIS.\n\nDo I have the education, experience, or skills needed to qualify?\nYou must have at least 1 year of qualifying experience.\nTo establish EB-1C eligibility, you must have been employed, in a primarily executive or managerial capacity, outside the United States for at least 1 year in the 3 years immediately preceding the filing of the petition or the most recent lawful nonimmigrant admission if you are already in the United States.\n\nDo I need to have a job offer? Do I need a company to submit a petition for me?\nYou must have a job offer to work in a primarily managerial or executive position for a United States employer that has a qualifying relationship with your foreign employer. The U.S. employer must file a petition for you.\n\nA qualifying relationship\nA qualifying relationship exists when the U.S. employer is an affiliate, parent, or subsidiary of the foreign firm, corporation, or other legal entity. To establish a qualifying relationship under the statute and the regulations, the petitioner must show that the beneficiary's foreign employer and the proposed U.S. employer are the same employer (for example, a U.S. entity with a foreign office) or related as a parent and subsidiary or as affiliates.\n\nBoth the U.S. employer and at least one qualifying organization abroad must continue to do business up until the time of visa issuance or adjustment of status, and the U.S. employer must have been actively engaged in doing business for at least 1 year at the time of filing of the petition.\n\nA qualifying position\nTo qualify for EB-1C classification, you must be coming to the United States to work in a primarily managerial or executive position with a qualifying U.S. employer. Managerial capacity includes personnel and function manager positions that manage, supervise and control certain personnel or organizational functions while executive capacity includes executive positions that direct management, establish goals and policies, and exercise wide latitude in discretionary decision making within an organization.\n\nWill I be working in the United States on a permanent (no time limit) basis as a lawful permanent resident or will I be working on a temporary basis as a nonimmigrant for a specified period of time?\n\nYou will be working in the United States on a permanent basis if you are granted lawful permanent resident status.\n\n\nEB-2 Advanced Degree Professionals and Persons of Exceptional Ability\nA professional with an advanced degree or a person of exceptional ability may enter the United States to work for a petitioning employer or, if self-petitioning, in a proposed endeavor by requesting a waiver of the labor certification process in the national interest.\n\nThe EB-2 classification is divided into two sub-categories: professionals with advanced degrees and individuals with exceptional ability in the sciences, arts, or business. Although a job offer from an employer and a labor certification from the Department of Labor are generally required for the EB-2 classification, you may be eligible to self-petition if you are asking for a waiver of the labor certification requirement based on the national interest. This self-petition, which does not require a sponsoring employer and skips the labor certification process, is known as a national interest waiver.\n\nNote: The labor certification process confirms that there are not sufficient U.S. workers able, willing, qualified, and available to accept the job opportunity in the area of intended employment and that employment of the foreign worker will not adversely affect the wages and working conditions of similarly employed U.S. workers. More information on the labor certification process is available in the USCIS Policy Manual (https://www.uscis.gov/policy-manual/volume-6-part-e-chapter-6), and on the Department of Labor’s website (https://www.dol.gov/agencies/eta/foreign-labor).\n\nIf you are requesting a waiver of the job offer (and thus, the labor certification) because it is in the national interest of the United States, you are eligible to file a petition on your own behalf, and you may do so whether you seek to classify yourself as a member of a profession who has an advanced degree or as an individual of exceptional ability.\n\nDo I have the education, experience, or skills needed to qualify?\nWe will review all the evidence you submit to determine whether you are eligible for the employment based second preference classification and, if requested, whether it is in the national interest of the United States to grant a discretionary waiver of the job offer and labor certification requirement.\n\nEmployment Based Second Preference: EB-2 Classification - General Requirements\nYou must be a professional with an advanced degree or a person with exceptional ability in the sciences, arts, or business. You are generally required to have a job offer and a labor certification from the Department of Labor.\n\nRequirements for Advanced Degree Professional Classification\nTo qualify for classification as an advanced degree professional, you must be a member of the professions holding an advanced degree",

You are generally required to have a job offer and a labor certification from the Department of Labor.\n\nRequirements for Advanced Degree Professional Classification\nTo qualify for classification as an advanced degree professional, you must be a member of the professions holding an advanced degree or foreign equivalent degree, and the position certified in the underlying labor certification must require, at a minimum, a professional holding such a degree (a bachelor’s followed by at least 5 years of progressively responsible experience is considered the equivalent of an advanced degree).\nYou will need to provide documentation, such as an official academic record showing that you have a U.S. advanced degree or a foreign equivalent degree, or an official academic record showing that you have a U.S. bachelor’s degree or a foreign equivalent degree and letters from current or former employers showing that you have at least 5 years of progressive post-bachelor’s work experience in the specialty. If a doctoral degree is customarily required by the specialty, you must have a U.S. doctorate or foreign equivalent degree.\nThe USCIS Policy Manual includes detailed guidance on how we determine eligibility for advanced degree professionals (https://www.uscis.gov/policy-manual/volume-6-part-f-chapter-5#S-A).\n\nRequirements for Exceptional Ability Classification\nTo qualify for the EB-2 exceptional ability classification, you must show that you have exceptional ability in the sciences, arts, or business. Your initial evidence must include evidence that affirmatively answers at least 3 of the 6 questions below:\n1. Have you received a degree, diploma, certificate or similar award from a college, university, school, or other institution, relating to the field of exceptional ability?\n2. Do you have at least 10 years of full-time experience in your field, as demonstrated by letters from current or former employers?\n3. Do you have a license or certification to practice in your profession or occupation?\n4. Have you commanded a high salary or other remuneration for your services, which demonstrates your exceptional ability?\n5. Are you a member of any professional associations?\n6. Have you been recognized for any achievements and significant contributions to the industry by peers, governmental entities, or professional or business organizations?\n\nNote: If any of the criteria discussed in this section do not readily apply to your occupation, you may submit comparable evidence to establish your eligibility.\nIf you meet these minimum threshold requirements, USCIS will then evaluate all the evidence you submitted in its totality to determine whether you have a degree of expertise significantly above that normally encountered in the sciences, arts, or business.\nThe USCIS Policy Manual includes detailed guidance on how we determine eligibility for exceptional ability classification (https://www.uscis.gov/policy-manual/volume-6-part-f-chapter-5#S-B).\n\nDo I need to have a job offer? Do I need a company to submit a petition for me?\nThe EB-2 classification normally requires a job offer from a U.S. employer. In general, the U.S. employer first obtains a labor certification approval from the Department of Labor and then files a petition on your behalf with USCIS.\nFor nurses who may qualify under EB-2, and physical therapists, a labor certification from the Department of Labor is not required. Instead, the petition is submitted with an uncertified ETA Form 9089 for consideration as Schedule A, Group I occupation. More information on Schedule A, Group I is available in the USCIS Policy Manual (https://www.uscis.gov/policy-manual/volume-6-part-e-chapter-7).\nYou may seek a waiver of the job offer (and thus the labor certification requirement) and petition for yourself with no U.S. employer if you can establish that it is in the national interest to waive the job offer requirement.\n\nNational Interest Waiver Requirements\nUSCIS may, as a matter of discretion, grant your request for a national interest waiver where the below requirements are met:\n1. Your proposed endeavor has both substantial merit and national importance.\n2. You are well positioned to advance the proposed endeavor.\n3. On balance, it would be beneficial to the United States to waive the requirements of a job offer, and thus the labor certification.\n\nThe USCIS Policy Manual includes detailed guidance on how we evaluate eligibility for national interest waivers based on the above requirements (https://www.uscis.gov/policy-manual/volume-6-part-f-chapter-5#S-D), and it also includes a discussion of specific evidentiary considerations for those well positioned to advance STEM endeavors (https://www.uscis.gov/policy-manual/volume-6-part-f-chapter-5#S-D-2). For example, the USCIS Policy Manual explains how an advanced degree in a STEM field tied to a proposed endeavor in a critical and emerging technology or supports U.S. national security or economic competitiveness is a strong positive factor, as are letters from interested government agencies.\n\nCritical and emerging technologies are those that are critical to U.S. national security, including military defense and the economy. To identify a critical and emerging technology field, USCIS considers governmental, academic, and other authoritative and instructive sources, and all other evidence submitted by the petitioner. The lists of critical and emerging technology subfields published by the Executive Office of the President, by either the National Science and Technology Council or the National Security Council, are examples of authoritative lists. For example, the National Science and Technology Council’s Critical and Emerging Technologies List Update (PDF)(https://www.whitehouse.gov/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Critical-and-Emerging-Technologies-List-2024-Update.pdf)(February 2024) identifies critical and emerging technologies “",

The lists of critical and emerging technology subfields published by the Executive Office of the President, by either the National Science and Technology Council or the National Security Council, are examples of authoritative lists. For example, the National Science and Technology Council’s Critical and Emerging Technologies List Update (PDF)(https://www.whitehouse.gov/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Critical-and-Emerging-Technologies-List-2024-Update.pdf)(February 2024) identifies critical and emerging technologies “with the potential to further these [national security] objectives,” meaning security of Americans, economic prosperity, or democratic values. Departments and agencies may consult this list “when developing, for example, initiatives to research and develop technologies that support national security missions, compete for international talent, and protect sensitive technology from misappropriation and misuse.” The list is part of A Report by the Fast Track Action Subcommittee on Critical and Emerging Technologies.\n\nA STEM area is important to competitiveness or security in a variety of circumstances. For example, when the evidence in the record demonstrates that an endeavor will help the United States to remain ahead of strategic competitors or current and potential adversaries, or relates to a field, including those that are research and development-intensive industries. One, but certainly not the only, indicator of STEM areas important to U.S. competitiveness is inclusion as a priority in the annual research and development priorities memo about the President’s budget issued jointly by the White House Director of the Office of Science and Technology Policy and the Director of the Office of Management and Budget. For example, the Memorandum on Research and Development Priorities (PDF) (https://www.whitehouse.gov/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/M-21-32-Multi-Agency-Research-and-Development-Prioirties-for-FY-2023-Budget-.pdf) (August 2021) for President Biden’s FY2022 budget is indicative of STEM areas important to U.S. competitiveness. U.S. national security objectives are outlined in the Interim National Security Strategic Guidance (PDF) (https://www.whitehouse.gov/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/NSC-1v2.pdf). These objectives include: protect the security of the American people; expand economic prosperity and opportunity; and realize and defend democratic values. For purposes of national interest waiver policy and adjudications, “national security” refers to these three objectives.\n\nMany proposed endeavors that aim to advance STEM technologies and research, whether in academic or industry settings, not only have substantial merit in relation to U.S. science and technology interests, but also have sufficiently broad potential implications to demonstrate national importance. On the other hand, while proposed classroom teaching activities in STEM, for example, may have substantial merit in relation to U.S. educational interests, such activities, by themselves, generally are not indicative of an impact in the field of STEM education more broadly, and therefore generally would not establish their national importance.\n\nUSCIS considers an advanced degree, particularly a Doctor of Philosophy (Ph.D.), in a STEM field tied to the proposed endeavor and related to work furthering a critical and emerging technology or other STEM area important to U.S. competitiveness or national security, an especially positive factor to be considered along with other evidence for purposes of the assessment under the second prong.\n\nWhen evaluating the third prong and whether the United States may benefit from the person’s entry, regardless of whether other U.S. workers are available (as well as other factors relating to prong three discussed above, such as urgency), USCIS considers the following combination of facts contained in the record to be a strong positive factor:\n1. The person possesses an advanced STEM degree, particularly a Ph.D.;\n2. The person will be engaged in work furthering a critical and emerging technology or other STEM area important to U.S. competitiveness; and\n3. The person is well positioned to advance the proposed STEM endeavor of national importance.\n\nThe benefit is given particular weight where the endeavor has the potential to support U.S. national security or enhance U.S. economic competitiveness, or when the petition is supported by letters from interested U.S. government agencies.\n\nWill I be working in the United States on a permanent (no time limit) basis as a lawful permanent resident or will I be working on a temporary basis as a nonimmigrant for a specified period of time?\nYou will be working in the United States on a permanent basis if you are granted lawful permanent resident status.\n\nEB-3 Skilled Workers, Professionals, and Other (Unskilled) Workers\nSkilled workers, professionals, and other workers may be eligible to permanently work in the United States if petitioned by a sponsoring U.S. employer.\n\n“Skilled workers” are persons whose jobs require a minimum of 2 years’ training or experience (including in STEM fields). The skilled worker must meet the educational, training, or experience requirements of the job opportunity as listed on the labor certification. Relevant post-secondary education, such as an associate’s degree in telecommunications technology, may be considered as training.\n\n“Professionals” are persons whose job requires at least a U.S. bachelor’s or foreign equivalent degree and are a member of the professions.\n\n“Other workers” are persons whose jobs require less than 2 years’ training or experience. The other worker must meet the educational, training, or experience requirements of the job opportunity as listed on the labor certification.  Because STEM occupations generally do not fall under the other worker classification, it is not further addressed in this guide.\n\nDo I have the education, experience, or skills needed to qualify?\nYou must have at least 2 years of experience or training (relevant post-secondary education may be considered as training) to qualify as a skilled worker.

J-1 nonimmigrants are therefore sponsored by an exchange program that is designated as such by the U.S. Department of State. These programs are designed to promote the interchange of persons, knowledge, and skills, in the fields of education, arts, and science.\n\nIn January 2022, DOS announced (https://www.state.gov/new-initiatives-further-opportunity-for-international-stem-students-scholars-and-researchers-u-s-entities/) measures to increase the flow of talent in science, technology, engineering, and math (STEM) fields. The Early Career STEM Research Initiative (https://j1visa.state.gov/programs/early-career-stem-research-initiative/) connects certain J-1 program sponsors with STEM-relevant sponsors, including businesses.\n\nInformation on the education, experience, and skills required to qualify is available at the DOS website (https://j1visa.state.gov/basics/).\n\nExamples of exchange visitors include, but are not limited to:\n1. Professors or scholars\n2. Research assistants\n3. Students\n4. Trainees\n5. Teachers\n6. Specialists\n6. Au pairs\n7. Camp counselors\n\nApplication Process\nThe U.S. Department of State plays the primary role in administering the J-1 exchange visitor program, so the first step in obtaining a J-1 visa is to submit a Form DS-2019, Certificate of Eligibility for Exchange Visitor Status, (formerly known as an IAP-66). Your sponsoring agency will provide you this form. You should work closely with the officials at your sponsoring agency who will be assisting you through this process. An official who is authorized to issue Form DS-2019 is known as a responsible officer (RO) or alternate responsible officer (ARO). Your RO or ARO will explain to you what documents are needed in order to be issued a DS-2019.\nAfter you have obtained a Form DS-2019, you may then apply for a J-1 visa through the U.S. Department of State at a U.S. Embassy or Consulate. The waiting time for an interview appointment for applicants can vary, so submitting your visa application as early as possible is strongly encouraged (though you may not enter the United States in J-1 status more than 30 days before your program begins).\n\nEmployment\nSome J-1 nonimmigrants enter the United States specifically to work while others do not. Employment is authorized for J-1 nonimmigrants only under the terms of the exchange program. Please check with your sponsoring agency for more information on any restrictions that may apply to you working in the United States.\n\nFamily of J-1 Visa Holders\nYour spouse and unmarried children under 21 years of age, regardless of nationality, are entitled to J-2 classification. Your spouse and children are entitled to employment authorization; however, their income may not be used to support you. To apply for employment authorization as a J-2 nonimmigrant, your spouse or child would file Form I-765, Application for Employment Authorization. For more information on the application procedures, see the “Employment Authorization” (https://www.uscis.gov/employment-authorization) page.\n\n\nRelated Links\nForm\n1.

F-1 Students\nAn F-1 student returning to the United States from a temporary absence of 5 months or less may be readmitted for attendance at an educational institution certified by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) Student and Exchange Visitor Program (SEVP) if the F-1 student presents:\n\nA current Certificate of Eligibility for Nonimmigrant Student Status (Form I-20) properly endorsed by the Designated School Official (DSO) for reentry if there has been no substantive change to the most recent Form I-20 information;[1] or\nAn updated Form I-20 if there has been a substantive change in the information on the F-1 student’s most recent Form I-20, such as in the case of an F-1 student who has changed the major area of study, who intends to transfer to another SEVP-certified institution, or who has advanced to a higher level of study;[2] and\nA valid F nonimmigrant visa, unless otherwise exempt.[3]\nIf an F-1 student leaves the United States for more than 5 months and is not able to remain enrolled at the student’s ICE SEVP-certified school, the student will not be able to maintain student status.[4] To resume the program of study in the United States, the student will need to seek readmission in initial status, which includes obtaining a new Form I-20.[5]\n\nFor information about requirements for F-1 student participation in study abroad programs, see DHS’s Study in the States webpage.\n\nTime spent outside of the United States does not extend the period of authorized Optional Practical Training (OPT). Time spent overseas counts towards the F-1 student’s aggregate maximum allowed period of unemployment.[6] An F-1 student currently approved for OPT may re-enter the United States to engage in OPT if the student has a current visa (if applicable), a Form I-20 endorsed for travel by the student’s DSO within the last 6 months, and an unexpired Employment Authorization Document (Form I-765).\n\nB. M-1 Students\nAn M-1 student returning to the United States from a temporary absence to attend the school that the student was previously authorized to attend must present:[7]\n\nA properly endorsed Form I-20 if there has been no substantive change in the information on the student’s most recent Form I-20 since the form was initially issued; or\nA new Form I-20 if there has been any substantive change in the information on the student’s most recent Form I-20 since the form was initially issued; and\nA valid M nonimmigrant visa, unless otherwise exempt.[8]\nIf USCIS has authorized an M-1 student to transfer between schools and the student is returning to the United States from a temporary absence to attend the school to which the transfer was authorized as indicated on the student’s Form I-20, the name of the transfer-in school does not need to be specified in the student’s visa.[9]\n\nIf USCIS has authorized an M-1 student to engage in practical training and the student is returning to the United States from a temporary absence, the M-1 student may be readmitted for the remainder of the authorized period indicated on the student's Form I–20. The student must be returning to the United States to perform the authorized practical training.\n\nAn M-1 student may not be admitted to begin practical training that was not authorized before the student’s departure.[10] As a result, if an M-1 student departs the United States while an Application for Employment Authorization (Form I-765) is pending, USCIS denies the Form I-765.\n\nFootnotes:\n[^ 1] See (https://www.ecfr.gov/current/title-8/chapter-I/subchapter-B/part-214/subpart-A/section-214.2).\n\n[^ 2] See (https://www.ecfr.gov/current/title-8/chapter-I/subchapter-B/part-214/subpart-A/section-214.2).\n\n[^ 3] See (https://www.ecfr.gov/current/title-8/chapter-I/subchapter-B/part-212/section-212.1). \n\n[^ 4] See (https://www.ecfr.gov/current/title-8/chapter-I/subchapter-B/part-214/subpart-A/section-214.2).\n\n[^ 5] See (https://www.ecfr.gov/current/title-8/chapter-I/subchapter-B/part-214/subpart-A/section-214.2).\n\n[^ 6] See (https://www.ecfr.gov/current/title-8/chapter-I/subchapter-B/part-214/subpart-A/section-214.2).\n\n[^ 7] See (https://www.ecfr.gov/current/title-8/chapter-I/subchapter-B/part-214/subpart-A/section-214.2).\n\n[^ 8] See (https://www.ecfr.gov/current/title-8/chapter-I/subchapter-B/part-212/section-212.1).\n\n[^ 9] See (https://www.ecfr.gov/current/title-8/chapter-I/subchapter-B/part-214/subpart-A/section-214.2).\n\n[^ 10] See (https://www.ecfr.gov/current/title-8/chapter-I/subchapter-B/part-214/subpart-A/section-214.2).",

This stopgap measure is intended to address certain particularly difficult situations, including those that previously may have forced individuals on the path to lawful permanent residence to abruptly stop working and leave the United States. Read our Policy Manual (https://www.uscis.gov/policy-manual) for more detailed information, as well as our resource on Options for Nonimmigrant Workers Following Termination of Employment (https://www.uscis.gov/working-in-the-united-states/information-for-employers-and-employees/options-for-nonimmigrant-workers-following-termination-of-employment).\n1. Category (c)(35) is for principal beneficiaries of approved Form I-140s who are in the United States in E-3, H-1B, H-1B1, L-1, or O-1 nonimmigrant status and are applying for an initial grant of employment authorization based on “compelling circumstances,” or a renewal of such authorization.\n2. Category (c)(36) is for qualifying dependent spouses and children of a principal beneficiary granted employment authorization under category (c)(35).\n\nUSCIS may grant employment authorization and issue an Employment Authorization Document (EAD) in these two categories for up to one year if we determine that there are compelling circumstances that justify issuing employment authorization.\n\nNOTE: USCIS considers an applicant with a valid EAD based on compelling circumstances to be in a period of authorized stay by the Secretary of Homeland Security. If you receive a compelling circumstances EAD, and begin working based on this EAD, you will be in a period of authorized stay, but you will no longer be maintaining your nonimmigrant status. However, you generally will not accrue unlawful presence in the U.S. while the EAD is valid or, if you filed a non-frivolous application on time, while your application is pending.\n\nEligibility Requirements\nYou are eligible to apply for an initial EAD under category (c)(35) if you:\n1. Are in the United States in E-3, H-1B, H-1B1, O-1, or L-1 nonimmigrant status, including in any applicable grace period, on the date you file the application for employment authorization;\n2. Are the principal beneficiary of an approved Form I-140;\n3. Can establish that an immigrant visa is not authorized for issuance to you based on your priority date, preference category, and country of chargeability according to the Final Action Date (https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/legal/visa-law0/visa-bulletin.html) in effect according to the Department of State’s Visa Bulletin on the date you file your application for employment authorization; and\n4. Can demonstrate that compelling circumstances exist that would justify USCIS using its discretion to issue you an independent grant of employment authorization.\n\nIf you want to renew an EAD under category (c)(35), please see the Renewing Your Employment Authorization section below.\nYour family members may also apply for employment authorization under category (c)(36). If approved, the validity period for their EADs may not extend beyond the period authorized for you, the principal beneficiary.\n\nHow to Apply\nYou must file Form I-765, Application for Employment Authorization (https://www.uscis.gov/i-765), to request an initial grant of employment authorization under category (c)(35) or (c)(36). You must receive an EAD from USCIS before you can begin working under this employment authorization.\nCarefully follow these steps to prevent your application from being rejected and returned to you:\n1.

We will reject any application that is not accompanied by the proper filing fees or signature. Read the Filing Fee section on the Form I-765 page to find what fee to pay.\n2. Submit supporting evidence (see chart below). Submitting sufficient supporting evidence will minimize the likelihood that we will need to send you a request for more evidence.\n\nIf You Are Applying Under (c)(35) as a Principal Beneficiary\n\nTo establish: Your E-3, H-1B, H-1B1, O-1, or L-1 nonimmigrant status\nYou can submit: \n1.

First, you will need to consider whether you intend to employ the individual permanently or temporarily. Offering an noncitizen a permanent position could provide the basis for that individual to become a permanent resident, a process which will require that the individual file an additional application and satisfy separate requirements.\n\nPermanent Workers\nForeign workers may obtain permanent residence (a Green Card) if they are able to establish that they have unique skills, or are being offered a job in the United States that will not displace a U.S. worker or have an adverse effect on wages and working conditions of U.S. workers who are similarly employed. This latter determination is made by the Department of Labor and is demonstrated by obtaining a labor certification.\nPermanent worker visas are broken into five preference categories. For a description of the preference categories, see the Permanent Workers (https://www.uscis.gov/working-in-the-united-states/permanent-workers) page.\n\nDepartment of Labor: Labor Certification\nA U.S. employer who is “sponsoring” or petitioning for a permanent foreign worker may be required to obtain a labor certification from the Department of Labor (DOL) verifying that there are an insufficient number of available, qualified, and willing U.S. workers to fill the position, and that the employment will not have an adverse effect on the wages and working conditions of similarly situated U.S. workers. For more information, see the Permanent Labor Certification (https://www.dol.gov/agencies/eta/foreign-labor/programs/permanent) page.\n\nObtaining Permanent Residence (a Green Card) Through a Job Offer\nFor information on how you can obtain a Green Card, see the Green Card for Employment-Based Immigrants (https://www.uscis.gov/green-card/green-card-eligibility/green-card-for-employment-based-immigrants) page.\n\nTemporary Workers\nThere are several temporary (nonimmigrant) categories which allow noncitizens to work in the United States. For a list of these nonimmigrant categories of temporary workers, as well as information on the petitioning process, see the Temporary Workers (https://www.uscis.gov/working-in-the-united-states/temporary-nonimmigrant-workers) page.\n\nDepartment of Labor: Labor Condition Application\nSome nonimmigrant categories require that a U.S. employer obtain a certification of labor condition application from the Department of Labor. That application requires the employer to state (“attest”) that it will comply with the following requirements:\n1. The employer must pay a wage that is no less than the wage paid to similarly qualified workers or, if greater, the prevailing wage for the position in the geographic area.\n2. The employer must provide working conditions that will not adversely affect other similarly employed workers.\n3. The employer must attest that there is no strike or lockout at the place of business of the prospective temporary worker.\n4. The employer must give notice to the bargaining representative or post a notice at the place of business that a labor condition application has been filed with the DOL.\n\nHow to Verify Employment Eligibility (Form I-9 and E-Verify)\nAll U.S. employers must verify the employment eligibility and identity of all employees hired to work in the United States after Nov. 6, 1986, by completing an Employment Eligibility Verification form (Form I-9) for all employees, including U.S. citizens. Employers who hire or continue to employ individuals knowing that they are not authorized to be employed in the United States may face civil and criminal penalties.\n\nAdditional Resources\n1.

See the Oct. 12, 2021, DHS Policy Statement 065-06 (https://www.dhs.gov/publication/memorandum-worksite-enforcement), “Worksite Enforcement: The Strategy to Protect the American Labor Market, the Conditions of the American Worksite, and the Dignity of the Individual.”\nWorkers are sometimes afraid to report violations of law by exploitative employers or to cooperate in employment and labor standards investigations because they fear removal or other immigration-related retaliation due to reports by an abusive employer. DHS’s practice of offering discretionary protection on a case-by-case basis to victims who lack employment authorization directly increases the ability of labor and employment agencies to more fully investigate worksite violations and support them in fulfilling their mission and holding abusive employers accountable, which protects all U.S. workers. The process changes announced today will streamline the exercise of DHS’s existing authority to grant such protection.\n\nFor Labor Agencies Submitting a Statement of Interest Form\nMultiple mechanisms in our immigration laws can provide employment authorization to noncitizen workers and protect them from removal, including discretionary relief such as deferred action or parole in place and other forms of relief such as T and U nonimmigrant visas (https://www.uscis.gov/humanitarian/victims-of-human-trafficking-and-other-crimes). There are also circumstances where a labor or employment agency may request expedited processing of a noncitizen’s pending application, petition, or request.\n\nA. Initial Requests for Deferred Action: Labor and employment agencies can seek DHS support in an ongoing investigation or enforcement action by providing workers with a Statement of Interest that must be included as part of the noncitizen’s request for deferred action. The Statement of Interest must:\n1. Be addressed to the Department of Homeland Security;\n2. Detail the nature of the labor or employment agency’s investigation or enforcement action and the need for DHS support;\n3. Describe the agency’s enforcement interests that provide the basis for their request;\n4. Describe the worksite and the workers who may be helpful with the agency investigation or enforcement action; and\n5. Provide an agency point of contact who can address follow up questions from DHS.\n\nLabor agencies must submit a courtesy copy of any Statement of Interest to laborenforcement@dhs.gov. After providing a courtesy copy of the Statement of Interest to DHS, labor agencies can then provide workers with this Statement of Interest, which must be included with the noncitizen’s prospective request to DHS for deferred action.\nLabor agencies submitting a Statement of Interest for the first time or that have questions about the process are encouraged to seek technical assistance prior to submission. To request such assistance, please contact laborenforcement@dhs.gov.\n\nB. Subsequent Requests for Deferred Action:\nA noncitizen granted deferred action based on a labor agency enforcement interest may request a subsequent period of deferred action for an additional two years when there continues to be an ongoing labor agency need. Subsequent requests must be accompanied by an updated Statement of Interest from the labor agency explaining the continued need for workers to assist in their investigation or prosecution, or in the enforcement of any court order or settlement agreement. The updated Statement of Interest must include the required details listed above, and also describe the scope of workers who are in need of continued protection based on the procedural posture of the labor agency’s investigation, prosecution, or enforcement actions.\nLabor agencies must submit a courtesy copy of any updated Statement of Interest to laborenforcement@dhs.gov. After providing a courtesy copy of any Statement of Interest to DHS, labor agencies can then provide workers with this Statement of Interest, which must be included with the noncitizen’s prospective, subsequent request to DHS for deferred action.\n\nC. Expedited Requests for Deferred Action:\nIn addition, labor agencies can seek expedited processing of a noncitizen’s pending immigration benefit request, such as an application for a change or adjustment of status. Such requests must be made by a senior-level agency official. If the request relates to employment authorization, the request should demonstrate that the need for a person to be employment-authorized is mission-critical and goes beyond a general need to retain a particular worker or person. Examples include, but are not limited to, a noncitizen victim or witness cooperating with a federal, state, or local agency who is in need of employment authorization because the respective agency is seeking back pay or reinstatement in an enforcement action or other court proceeding.\n\nProcess for Noncitizens Requesting Deferred Action\nProcess for Noncitizens Requesting Deferred Action Infographic (https://www.dhs.gov/medialibrary/assets/graphic/50668)\nDeferred action is a form of prosecutorial discretion to defer removal action against a noncitizen for a certain period of time. Although deferred action does not confer lawful status or excuse any past or future periods of unlawful presence, a noncitizen granted deferred action is considered lawfully present in the United States for certain limited purposes while the deferred action is in effect. DHS can terminate deferred action at any time, at its discretion.\nUnder existing regulations, a noncitizen granted deferred action may apply for and obtain employment authorization for the period of deferred action if they demonstrate “an economic necessity for employment.”\nNoncitizen workers who fall within the scope of a labor agency investigation can submit their requests for deferred action to USCIS through a central intake point specifically established to handle requests for deferred action related to labor agency investigative efforts.

Deferred action is a form of prosecutorial discretion to defer removal action (deportation) against a noncitizen for a certain period of time. Although deferred action does not confer lawful status or excuse any past or future periods of unlawful presence, a noncitizen granted deferred action is considered lawfully present in the United States for certain limited purposes, while the deferred action is in effect. If granted deferred action, a noncitizen may be eligible for employment authorization. DHS can terminate deferred action at any time, at its discretion.\n\nQ2. Has DHS already granted deferred action to noncitizens who are participating in labor agency investigations?\nA2. Yes. DHS grants deferred action to noncitizen workers on a case-by-case basis at its discretion.\n\nQ3. How does the centralized deferred action process work?\nA3. A noncitizen requesting deferred action based on a labor agency investigation or need submits a written request for deferred action by submitting:\n1. A request for deferred action signed by the noncitizen which describes the basis for their request for deferred action;\n2. A Statement of Interest from a labor or employment agency addressed to DHS supporting the request;\n3. Evidence to establish that the worker falls within the category of workers identified in the Statement of Interest, such as W-2s, pay stubs, time cards, and/or other documentary evidence such as a signed affidavit to demonstrate that the worker was employed during the period specified in the labor or employment agency statement;\n4. Evidence of any additional factors supporting a favorable exercise of discretion;\n5. Proof of the noncitizen’s identity and nationality;\n6. If applicable, any document used to lawfully enter the U.S. or other evidence relating to the noncitizen’s immigration history or status;\n7.

Form G-28, Notice of Entry of Appearance as Attorney or Accredited Representative (https://www.uscis.gov/g-28), if applicable.\n\nThe noncitizen will submit this request to:\nUSCIS\nAttn: Deferred Action – Labor Investigations\n10 Application Way\nMontclair, CA 91763-1350\n\nAttorneys who are submitting deferred action requests for multiple noncitizens should submit each individual application in its own envelope.\nUSCIS will refer to ICE any deferred action requests that fall within ICE’s authority, including requests submitted by noncitizens who are in removal proceedings or have a final order of removal.\nAs with any request for deferred action, DHS will review requests by noncitizens based on a labor agency investigation or need on a case-by-case basis. DHS will review all positive and negative factors present in the requestor’s case when considering whether to exercise discretion to grant deferred action.\nIf deferred action is granted through this process, the initial period of deferred action and employment authorization will generally be for a period up to four years.\n\nQ4. Can a noncitizen worker who would otherwise fit within the scope of a labor-related request for prosecutorial discretion described in this FAQ but who does not want to submit a Form I-765, Application for Employment Authorization, request deferred action?\nA4. Yes. A noncitizen worker who falls within the scope of a labor agency investigation but who does not want to submit a Form I-765, Application for Employment Authorization, may request deferred action by submitting their request in accordance with the general instructions for requesting deferred action (https://www.uscis.gov/g-325a).\n\nQ5. May a noncitizen granted deferred action be eligible for employment authorization?\nA5. Individuals granted deferred action may be eligible for employment authorization under existing regulations at 8 C.F.R. 274a.12(c)(14), which require them to demonstrate an economic necessity for employment. Noncitizens submitting a deferred action request through this centralized process must concurrently submit their Form I-765, Application for Employment Authorization, with the appropriate fee or request a few waiver, if they are requesting employment authorization. If DHS grants deferred action, we will then adjudicate the Form I-765. Note that if DHS does not grant deferred action, we will not refund or return the Form I-765 fee. If the requestor does not want to file Form I-765 with their deferred action request, they can send their Form I-765 by following USCIS' standard procedure (https://www.uscis.gov/g-325a).\n\nQ6. What agency will be reviewing requests for deferred action from noncitizen workers?\nA6.

Requests for deferred action made by noncitizen workers who are participating in or otherwise necessary to a labor agency investigation should be submitted to USCIS through the central intake point specifically established to support labor agency investigative efforts for deferred action requests. USCIS will review the request, as well as the noncitizen’s immigration history, to determine which office within DHS has authority over the request. Upon reviewing the submission for completeness, USCIS will only forward to ICE requests for deferred action that are submitted by noncitizens who are in removal proceedings or have a final order of removal. USCIS and ICE, as appropriate, will consider and make a case-by-case determination of the deferred action request, and USCIS will consider all related Forms I-765, if submitted.\n\nQ7. If deferred action is granted through this process, when does it end?\nA7. If deferred action is approved, it may be granted generally for an initial period of up to four years, subject to termination at any time. The recipient may also be eligible to submit a subsequent request for deferred action (see question 14 below), which will be adjudicated on a case-by-case basis when a labor agency provides a basis for such a request as it relates to the labor agency’s ongoing investigative or enforcement interests. Subsequent requests if granted, based on a labor agency investigation or need, will generally be for an additional period up to two years.\n\nQ8. What other immigration benefits can a noncitizen worker pursue if they are not granted deferred action?\nA8. A noncitizen worker who is the victim of a crime or subject to exploitation by an unscrupulous employer and cooperating in a labor agency investigation may be eligible for other forms of immigration relief beyond deferred action, including eligibility for a T or U nonimmigrant visa (https://www.uscis.gov/humanitarian/victims-of-human-trafficking-and-other-crimes) or parole in place.\n\nQ9. How can a labor agency find out more about this process?\nA9. Labor agency representatives can contact laborenforcement@dhs.gov to learn more about this process and request technical assistance.\n\nQ10. When can the labor agency distribute the Statement of Interest to workers to submit as part of their deferred action request?\nA10. Labor agencies must provide a courtesy copy of the Statement of Interest to laborenforcement@dhs.gov before providing the Statement of Interest to any workers. Once they have provided a courtesy copy, labor agencies can provide the Statement of Interest to the worker, who must include the Statement of Interest in their request for deferred action. Labor agencies submitting a Statement of Interest for the first time or that have questions about the process are encouraged to seek technical assistance prior to submission. For such assistance, please e-mail laborenforcement@dhs.gov.\n\nQ11. Will a noncitizen receive a Social Security Number?\nA11. When a noncitizen files Form I-765, Application for Employment Authorization, they can apply for a Social Security Number (SSN) on the same form. If USCIS approves their application to work in the U.S. and the noncitizen completed the section on the application to request an SSN card, then USCIS will send the Social Security Administration (SSA) the data needed to issue the noncitizen an SSN card.\nIf USCIS approves Form I-765, the noncitizen will receive two documents – their Employment Authorization Document (EAD), also known as the “USCIS I-766 card” or “work permit”, and in another envelope their SSN card. The SSA will mail the SSN card to the address the noncitizen listed on their I-765 application. The noncitizen should receive their SSN card no later than 7 business days after they receive their EAD from USCIS.\nIf a noncitizen does not receive their SSN card within 7 business days after receiving their EAD, they should call or visit an SSA office. For more information, please review this flyer (PDF, 400.77 KB) (https://www.uscis.gov/sites/default/files/document/flyers/EBE_Flyer_Apply_for_your_Social_Security_Number_While_Applying_for_Your.pdf).\n\nQ12. Will DHS consider a request submitted by a labor or employment agency to expedite a noncitizen’s pending immigration benefit request on the basis of a labor agency’s need?\nA12. Yes. On a case-by-case basis, we will consider a request submitted by a senior-level official of the labor or employment agency for expedited processing of a noncitizen’s pending immigration benefit request, including but not limited to Form I-765, Application for Employment Authorization, submitted outside of a request for labor investigation-based deferred action under the centralized intake process, Form I-485, Application to Register Permanent Residence or Adjust Status, Form I-130, Petition for Alien Relative, U Bona Fide Determination, or other pending immigration benefit request.\nIf the expedite request relates to employment authorization, the request should demonstrate a critical and otherwise compelling need for a person to be employment authorized. Examples include, but are not limited to, a noncitizen victim or witness cooperating with a federal, state, or local agency who is in need of employment authorization because the respective agency is seeking back pay or reinstatement in an enforcement action or other court proceeding.\nMore information on how to request expedited processing can be found on the How to Make an Expedite Request (https://www.uscis.gov/forms/filing-guidance/expedite-requests) page.\n\nQ13.

How does a noncitizen submit a request for a replacement Employment Authorization Document (EAD)?\nA13.\n1. To request a replacement EAD due to the EAD being lost, stolen or damaged, please see the “Deferred Action” section on the Direct Filing Addresses for Form I-765, Application for Employment Authorization (https://www.uscis.gov/i-765-addresses) page to submit Form I-765 and applicable fees. \n2. To request a replacement EAD due to an error on the card, please see the “Replacement for Card Error” section on the Direct Filing Addresses for Form I-765, Application for Employment Authorization (https://www.uscis.gov/i-765-addresses) page. There is separate guidance for:\n    a. If a noncitizen needs to replace a card USCIS issued because it contains incorrect information that is not due to a USCIS error.\n    b. If a noncitizen needs to replace a card USCIS issued because it contains incorrect information that is due to a USCIS error.\n\n\nQ14. Can a noncitizen request subsequent periods of deferred action based on a labor agency investigation or need?\nA14. Yes. A noncitizen granted deferred action based on a labor agency investigation or need may request an additional two-year period of deferred action when there continues to be a labor agency need. Subsequent requests for deferred action based on a labor agency investigation or need must be accompanied by an updated labor agency Statement of Interest explaining the continued labor agency need. The Statement of Interest must also describe the scope of workers who are in need of protection based on the procedural posture of the labor agency’s investigation, prosecution, or enforcement action. \n\nQ15. How can a labor agency submit an updated Statement of Interest in support of a subsequent request for deferred action?\nA15. A labor agency that has a continued need for workers to help in their investigation or prosecution of a case, or any related enforcement action, may support a noncitizen’s subsequent request for deferred action by providing an updated Statement of Interest. The labor agency should make an assessment of the continuing need for worker participation and should reassess the scope of workers in need of protection based on the phase of the agency’s enforcement effort at that time.\nLabor agencies must provide workers with this updated Statement of Interest, which must be included as part of the noncitizen’s subsequent request for deferred action. Labor agencies must submit a courtesy copy of the Statement of Interest to laborenforcement@dhs.gov before providing the Statement of Interest to any workers.\n\nA16. A noncitizen requesting a subsequent period of deferred action based on a labor agency investigation or need must submit:\n1. A written request signed by the noncitizen stating basis for the deferred action request, including the continued need of the labor or employment agency;\n2. A Statement of Interest from a labor or employment agency addressed to DHS supporting the request;\n3. Evidence to establish that the worker falls within the scope specified in the Statement of Interest, such as W-2s, pay stubs, time cards, and/or other documentary evidence including a signed affidavit to demonstrate that the worker was employed during the period identified in the labor or employment agency statement\n4. Evidence of any additional factors supporting a favorable exercise of discretion, which may include evidence of the worker’s past participation or willingness to actively participate in the labor agency investigation;\n5. Proof of the noncitizen’s identity and nationality;\n6. If applicable, any document used to lawfully enter the United States and/or other evidence relating to the noncitizen’s immigration history or status;\n7. Form G-325A, Biographic Information (for Deferred Action) (https://www.uscis.gov/g-325a);\n8.

Additional information is available on the fee waiver page (https://www.uscis.gov/forms/filing-fees/additional-information-on-filing-a-fee-waiver).\nThe noncitizen will submit this request to:\nUSCIS\nAttn: Deferred Action – Labor Investigations\n10 Application Way\nMontclair, CA 91763-1350\n\nAttorneys who are submitting deferred action requests for multiple noncitizens should submit each individual application in its own envelope.\nUSCIS will refer to ICE any requests for deferred action that fall within ICE’s authority, including requests submitted by noncitizens who are in removal proceedings or have a final order of removal.\nAs with any request for deferred action, DHS will review requests for a subsequent period of deferred action based on a labor agency investigation or need on a case-by-case basis. DHS will review all positive and negative factors present in the requestor’s case when considering whether to exercise discretion to grant a subsequent period of deferred action. If granted, the subsequent period of deferred action will generally be for a period of up to 2 years, subject to termination at any time at the discretion of DHS.\n\nQ17. When can a noncitizen submit their subsequent request for deferred action?\nA17. Noncitizens should submit any subsequent request for deferred action to DHS at least 120 days",

When can a noncitizen submit their subsequent request for deferred action?\nA17. Noncitizens should submit any subsequent request for deferred action to DHS at least 120 days but no more than 180 days prior to the expiration of the current period of deferred action. Before submitting a subsequent request for deferred action, noncitizens should obtain an updated Statement of Interest from the labor agency and include the updated Statement of Interest with the subsequent request for deferred action to DHS.\nPlease note that if a subsequent request for deferred action is received by DHS with less than 120 days remaining in the current period of deferred action, there could be a gap between periods of deferred action and related employment authorization.\n\n\nQ18. If a noncitizen’s request for a subsequent period of deferred action is granted, when will the new period of deferred action begin?\nA18.\n1. If a noncitizen submits a request for a subsequent period of deferred action to DHS at least 120 days before and no more than 180 days prior to the expiration of their current period of deferred action and the request is granted, the noncitizen will generally receive deferred action and employment authorization for a period of up to 2 years starting from the expiration date of the current period of deferred action.\n2. If a noncitizen submits a request for a subsequent period of deferred action less than 120 days prior to the expiration of their current period of deferred action and the request is granted, there may be a gap between periods of deferred action and related employment authorization.\n3. If a noncitizen submits a request for a subsequent period of deferred action after the expiration date of their current period of deferred action and the subsequent request is granted, the noncitizen will have a lapse in the duration of their deferred action period and related employment authorization. In such instances, the noncitizen will generally receive deferred action and employment authorization for a period of up to 2 years from the grant date of the new request.\n\n\nQ19. Will noncitizens who apply for deferred action based on a labor agency investigation or need through this process be referred to ICE for enforcement action?\nA19. Through the centralized intake process, USCIS will forward to ICE only those requests for deferred action from noncitizens who are in removal proceedings already or who have a final order of removal, so that ICE can consider the request for deferred action. All other requests will be processed by USCIS. Consistent with all USCIS adjudications, USCIS generally will not refer cases to ICE post-decision absent national security public safety, and border security concerns.\n\nQ20. Can a noncitizen currently present in the United States on a nonimmigrant visa (such as H-2) who falls within the scope of a labor agency investigation request labor investigation-based deferred action through the centralized process?\nA20. Yes. A noncitizen worker who is present in the United States on a nonimmigrant visa (such as H-2) and who falls within the scope of a labor agency investigation can request labor investigation-based deferred action through the centralized process. The worker should indicate in their written request for deferred action their current immigration status and the expiration date of that status, while also providing a copy of their Form I-94, Arrival/Departure Record, reflecting that status. This will facilitate timely processing of the deferred action request and minimize the risk of gaps in employment authorization or accrual of unlawful presence.\n\nQ21. How does a noncitizen withdraw their pending request for labor investigation-based deferred action and employment authorization?\nA21. To withdraw a pending request for labor investigation-based deferred action and employment authorization, a noncitizen must submit a written withdrawal request with their name, signature, A#, and the receipt number listed on their Form I-797C, Notice of Action. Their written withdrawal request should indicate that the noncitizen is are withdrawing their request for deferred action and employment authorization.\n\nWithdrawal requests should be submitted to:\nUSCIS\nAttn: Deferred Action – Labor Investigations – Withdrawal \n10 Application Way\nMontclair, CA 91763-1350\n\nPlease note that if a noncitizen withdraws their pending request, they will not receive a refund of any fees paid for their application for employment authorization. All withdrawals are final and may not be retracted. However, withdrawing a pending request will not bar the noncitizen from requesting deferred action in the future.\n\nQ22. Can a noncitizen initially granted a two year period of deferred action and related employment authorization request an increase of the initial grant period from two to four years?\nA22. Yes. To request that the initial period of deferred action and related employment authorization be increased from two to four years, a noncitizen should submit the following to the address listed in Question 3 above:\n1. Form G-325A, Biographic Information (for Deferred Action). Please write “Labor DA Extension” on the top portion of the form.\n2. A written request signed by the noncitizen stating the desire to increase the deferred action period from two to four years;\n3. Proof of the noncitizen’s identity and nationality;\n4. The Statement of Interest from a labor or employment agency that supported the initial deferred action request;\n5. A copy of the approval notice from the initial deferred action request;\n6. Form I-765, Application for Employment Authorization, with the appropriate fee or request for a fee waiver; and\n7.

A noncitizen was initially granted deferred action for a period of two years. If the noncitizen submits a request to increase their initial deferred action time period from two years to four years, are they required to replace their employment authorization card to reflect a total of four years of validity?\nA23. Yes. Extending the initial authorized period of deferred action from two years to four years does not automatically extend the validity period of employment authorization. To remain employment authorized for the duration of their deferred action, a noncitizen must file a new I-765 and I-765 WS with fee or request for a fee waiver. If the noncitizen does not submit the I-765 and I-765WS with their request to extend the initial deferred action period from two years to four years, this may result in additional processing delays, denials, and loss of employment authorization.\n\nQ24. If a noncitizen was granted a two-year subsequent period of deferred action, can they request that the period be increased to four years?\nA24. No. If a noncitizen requested and were granted a subsequent period of deferred action, they have already obtained an initial two-year period and a subsequent two-year period for a total of four years. If there is a labor agency need beyond the four-year period of deferred action that the noncitizen has already obtained, the labor agency may issue a new Statement of Interest and the noncitizen may request another subsequent period of deferred action on that basis.",

Unretouched means the photos must not be edited or digitally enhanced. The submission of any mounted or retouched images will delay the processing of your application and may prompt USCIS to require that you appear at an Applicant Support Center to verify your identity.\n\nCertain F-1 students who receive science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) degrees may apply for a 24-month extension of their post-completion optional practical training (OPT).\n\nEligibility for the STEM OPT Extension\nTo qualify for the 24-month extension, you must:\n\n1. Have been granted OPT and currently be in a valid period of post-completion OPT;\n2. Have earned a bachelor’s, master’s, or doctoral degree from a school that is accredited by a U.S. Department of Education-recognized accrediting agency and is certified by the Student and Exchange Visitor Program (SEVP) at the time you submit your STEM OPT extension application.\n   a. Previously obtained STEM degrees: If you are an F-1 student participating in a 12-month period of post-completion OPT based on a non-STEM degree, you may be eligible to use a previous STEM degree from a U.S. institution of higher education to apply for a STEM OPT extension. You must have received both degrees from currently accredited and SEVP-certified institutions, and cannot have already received a STEM OPT extension based on this previous degree. The practical training opportunity also must be directly related to the previously obtained STEM degree.\n    For example, if the student is currently participating in OPT based on a non-STEM  degree, but previously received a bachelor’s degree in a degree program  that appears on the current DHS STEM Designated Degree Program List (https://www.ice.gov/sevis/schools#dhs-stem-designated-degree-program-list-and-cip-code-nomination-process), the student may be able to apply for a STEM OPT extension based on the bachelor’s degree as long as it is from an accredited U.S. college or university and the OPT employment opportunity is directly related to the bachelor’s STEM degree.\n   b. STEM degrees you obtain in the future: If you enroll in a new academic program in the future and earn another qualifying STEM degree at a higher educational level, you may be eligible for one additional 24-month STEM OPT extension.\n    For example: If you receive a 24-month STEM OPT extension based on a qualifying bachelor’s degree  and you later earn a qualifying master’s degree, you may apply for an additional 24-month STEM OPT extension based on your master’s degree.\n3. Work for an employer who meets all the requirements listed below in the STEM OPT Employer Responsibilities section.\n4. Submit the Form I-765,Application for Employment Authorization (https://www.uscis.gov/i-765), up to 90 days before your current OPT employment authorization expires, and within 60 days of the date your designated school official (DSO) enters the recommendation for OPT into your Student and Exchange Visitor Information System (SEVIS) record.\n\n\nApplying for a STEM OPT Extension\nTo apply for an extension, you must properly file:\n\n1. Form I-765 with\n   a. The correct application fee,\n   b. Your employer’s name as listed in E-Verify, and\n   c. Your employer’s E-Verify Company Identification Number or valid E-Verify Client Company Identification Number\n2. Form I-20, Certificate of Eligibility for Nonimmigrant Student Status, endorsed by your DSO within the last 60 days; and\n3. A copy of your STEM degree.\n\nIf you file your STEM OPT extension application on time and your OPT period expires while your extension application is pending, we will automatically extend your employment authorization for 180 days. This automatic 180-day extension ceases once USCIS adjudicates your STEM OPT extension application. F-1 students who have a pending STEM OPT extension application are not eligible for the temporary increase of the automatic extension period under the temporary final rule published on May 4, 2022, or the temporary increase of the automatic extension period under the temporary final rule [SMJ(2] published on April 8, 2024. Those temporary increases of the automatic extension period under 8 CFR 274a.13(d) only apply to the categories listed in the chart on the Automatic Employment Authorization Document (EAD) Extension page (https://www.uscis.gov/eadautoextend).\n\nAfter Receiving a STEM OPT Extension\nStudent Reporting Responsibilities\n\nIf you receive a STEM OPT extension, you must:\n\n1. Report changes to the following information to your DSO within 10 days of the change:\n   a. Your legal name\n   b. Your residential or mailing address\n   c. Your email address\n   d. Your employer’s name\n   e. Your employer’s address\n2. Report to your DSO every 6 months to confirm the information listed above, even if none of your information has changed.\n\nFor more information, please refer to the USCIS Policy Manual (https://www.uscis.gov/policy-manual/volume-2-part-f) and the DHS STEM OPT Hub (https://studyinthestates.dhs.gov/stem-opt-hub).\n\nUnemployment during the OPT Period\nYou may be unemployed during your OPT period for a limited number of days.\n1.

Be enrolled in E-Verify, as evidenced by either a valid E-Verify company identification number or, if the employer is using an employer agent to create its E-Verify cases, a valid E-Verify client company identification number.\n2. Remain a participant in good standing with E-Verify, as determined by USCIS.\n3. Have a valid Employer Identification Number (EIN) issued by the Internal Revenue Service for tax purposes.\n4. Report material changes of the STEM OPT student’s employment by submitting a modified Form I-983 to the DSO at the earliest available opportunity.\n5. Report the STEM OPT student’s termination of employment or departure to the DSO within 5 business days.\n6. Implement a formal training program to augment the student’s academic learning through practical experience.\n7. Provide an OPT opportunity that is commensurate with those of similarly situated U.S. workers in duties, hours, and compensation.\n\nTerms and Conditions for Employer Participation\nTo ensure the integrity of the program and provide safeguards for U.S. workers, any employer wishing to employ a student participating in the STEM OPT extension program must ensure that:\n\n1. The employer will have and maintain a bona fide employer-employee relationship with the student.\n2. The employer has sufficient resources and personnel available to provide appropriate training in connection with the specified opportunity at the location(s) specified in the Form I-983, Training Plan for STEM OPT Students.\n3. The STEM OPT student will not replace a full- or part-time, temporary or permanent U.S. worker.\n4. The training opportunity will assist the student in attaining his or her training goals.\n\nDHS may, at its discretion, conduct a site visit of the employer to ensure that program requirements are being met, including that the employer possesses and maintains the ability, personnel, and resources to provide structured and guided work-based learning experiences consistent with the training plan.\n\nThe Employer’s Training Obligation:\nAs noted above, to be eligible to employ a STEM OPT student, an employer must have and maintain a bona fide employer-employee relationship with the student. The employer must attest to this fact by signing the Form I-983, Training Plan for STEM OPT Students. To establish a bona fide relationship, the employer may not be the student’s “employer” in name only, nor may the student work for the employer on a “volunteer” basis. Moreover, the employer that signs the Form I-983 must be the same entity that provides the practical training experience to the student.\n\nAn employer must have sufficient resources and trained or supervisory personnel available to provide appropriate training in connection with the specified training opportunity at the location(s) where the student’s practical training experience will take place, as specified in the Form I-983. The “personnel” who may provide and supervise the training experience may be either employees of the employer, or contractors who the employer has directly retained to provide services to the employer; they may not, however, be employees or contractors of the employer’s clients or customers. Additionally, under no circumstances would another F-1 student with OPT or a STEM OPT extension (who is undergoing training in their own right) be qualified to train another F-1 student with a STEM OPT extension.\n\nWhile employers may rely on their existing training programs or policies to satisfy the requirements relating to performance evaluation and oversight and supervision, the student’s Training Plan must nevertheless be customized for the individual student. For instance, every Training Plan must describe the direct relationship between the STEM OPT opportunity and the student’s qualifying STEM degree, as well as the relationship between the STEM OPT opportunity and the student’s goals and objectives for work-based learning. Moreover, a STEM OPT employer may not assign, or otherwise delegate, its training responsibilities to a non-employer third party (e.g., a client/customer of the employer, employees of the client/customer, or contractors of the client/customer).\n\nAs noted above, DHS, at its discretion, may conduct a site visit of any STEM OPT employer to ensure that the employer possesses and maintains the ability and resources to provide structured and guided work-based learning experiences consistent with the Form I-983. See 8 C.F.R. 214.2(f)(10)(ii)(C)(11). Consistent with this provision, during a site visit, DHS may verify that the employer that signs the Form I-983 is the same entity that provides the practical training experience to the student and ensure compliance. For ICE to effectively conduct these site visits as part of its oversight responsibilities, it is important that employers report any change in a student’s employment address. As indicated above, the employer and student must report such a material change by submitting a modified Form I-983 to the DSO at the earliest available opportunity.\n\nThe Employer’s Training Obligation: Staffing and Temporary Agencies\n\nStaffing and temporary agencies and consulting firms may seek to employ students under the STEM OPT program, but only if they will be the entity that provides the practical training experience to the student and they have and maintain a bona fide employer-employee relationship with the student. STEM OPT participants may engage in a training experience that takes place at a site other than the employer’s principal place of business as long as all of the training obligations are met, including that the employer has and",

STEM OPT participants may engage in a training experience that takes place at a site other than the employer’s principal place of business as long as all of the training obligations are met, including that the employer has and maintains a bona fide employer-employee relationship with the student. Certain types of arrangements, including multiple employer arrangements, sole proprietorships, employment through ‘‘temp’’ agencies, employment through consulting firm arrangements that provide labor for hire, and other similar relationships may not be able to demonstrate a bona fide employer-employee relationship and, therefore, may not meet the requirements of the STEM OPT extension.\n\nAs part of the STEM OPT extension, employers must complete the appropriate parts of Form I-983, Training Plan for STEM OPT Students. In this form, employers attest that:\n\n1. They have enough resources and trained personnel available to appropriately train the student;\n2. The student will not replace a full- or part-time, temporary or permanent U.S. worker; and\n3. Working for them will help the student attain their training objectives.\n\nDHS will review on a case-by-case basis whether the student will be a bona fide employee of the employer signing the training plan, and verify that the employer that signs the training plan is the same entity that employs the student and provides the practical training experience.\nFor more information, please refer to the USCIS Policy Manual (https://www.uscis.gov/policy-manual/volume-2-part-f) and the DHS STEM OPT Hub (https://studyinthestates.dhs.gov/stem-opt-hub).",

General Eligibility for Change of Status to F-1\n1. Eligible Nonimmigrants\nIn general, nonimmigrants who have been lawfully admitted to the United States and maintain the status in which they were admitted (or previously changed to) may seek to change from one visa classification under INA 101(a)(15) to another, with certain restrictions.[1] The applicant must meet all eligibility criteria for the new visa classification.[2]\n\nGenerally, a nonimmigrant may apply to change to F-1 status while remaining in the United States if:\n\nThe applicant was lawfully admitted to the United States in a nonimmigrant status;\nThe applicant’s nonimmigrant status remains valid; and\nThe applicant has not violated the conditions of their nonimmigrant status.[3]\n2. Timing and Effective Date\nAcademic Program Start Date\n\nIn general, upon approval of a change of status (COS) to F-1, F-1 students may not engage in any student activities (with certain exceptions)[4] until 30 days before their academic program start date.\n\nOfficers grant the COS with an effective date of the applicant’s F-1 status as the day of final adjudication (approval), regardless of whether it falls within 30 days of the academic program start date.\n\nIf a COS to F-1 application is approved more than 30 days before the program start date, the nonimmigrant must ensure that they do not violate their F-1 status during that period of time. The student must ensure they maintain status by not engaging in impermissible activities.\n\nFor example, engaging in any employment, including on-campus employment and practical training more than 30 days before the program start date, is a violation of F-1 status.[5] In general, F-1 students admitted for duration of status who violate the terms of their status, begin to accrue unlawful presence on the day after USCIS or an immigration judge determines that they have violated their nonimmigrant status.[6]\n\nIn all cases, the student must fully comply with all applicable requirements of the Student and Exchange Visitor Program (SEVP).\n\nDuration of Status\n\nRegulations define the nonimmigrant student’s “duration of status” as the time during which an F-1 nonimmigrant is “pursuing a full course of study” at the approved educational institution.[7] USCIS considers the period of time between the approval of the COS to F-1 classification and the F-1 program start date as falling within the provision of “pursuing a full course of study.” This applies if the F-1 student continues to intend to pursue that course of study and does not otherwise violate their F-1 nonimmigrant status.\n\nUSCIS considers this period of time between the date of approval and the program start date as similar to the period of time and purpose a student is in the United States during summer vacation in F-1 status (such a break in classes does not interrupt status).\n\nDeferring Program Start Date\n\nIf a COS to F-1 application is not approved before the program start date reflected on the initial “Certificate of Eligibility for Nonimmigrant Student Status” (Form I-20), the applicant must request that their Designated School Official (DSO) defer the program start date in the Student and Exchange Visitor Information System (SEVIS) before the current program start date has been reached.\n\nThe applicant can monitor the status of their pending COS application and, in accordance with instructions provided on the SEVP website, may contact the DSO if it appears that the program start date may need to be deferred. The applicant and the DSO are responsible for ensuring that the SEVIS record is not terminated while the COS is pending.\n\nBackground\n\nUSCIS historically only granted applications to change to F-1 status within 30 days of the program start date listed on the applicant’s Form I-20. USCIS required nonimmigrants applying for COS to F-1 classification to continuously obtain nonimmigrant status up to 30 days before the start date of the program of study listed on the Form I-20, even if that required filing an initial extension and later a subsequent extension or extensions, or filing a COS and subsequent extension or extensions. This policy prevented students from incurring a “gap” in status prior to 30 days before the program’s start date, but resulted in the potential filing and adjudication of multiple, duplicative COS or extension of stay (sometimes referred to as “bridging”) applications.\n\nIn order to limit costs to applicants and the government, especially during periods of high volume and extended adjudication times, USCIS no longer requires the applicant to submit subsequent applications for extension or change of nonimmigrant status while the COS to F-1 application is pending with USCIS, provided that the applicant’s nonimmigrant status is unexpired at the time of filing the initial COS to F-1 application, and the applicant otherwise remains eligible for a COS.\n\nTo avoid a “gap” in status in cases that are adjudicated more than 30 days prior to the academic program start date but are otherwise approvable, USCIS grants the COS to F-1 effective the day USCIS makes a final decision on the COS application, which may in some cases result in a student being granted F-1 status more than 30 days prior to the program start date. \n\n3. Nonimmigrants Unable to Enroll in a Full Course of Study Seeking Change of Status to F-1 Classification\nCertain nonimmigrants, including visitors for business or pleasure (B-1 or B-2), are prohibited from enrolling in a full course of study.[8] Nonimmigrants who",

Nonimmigrants Unable to Enroll in a Full Course of Study Seeking Change of Status to F-1 Classification\nCertain nonimmigrants, including visitors for business or pleasure (B-1 or B-2), are prohibited from enrolling in a full course of study.[8] Nonimmigrants who wish to enroll in a full course of study but are unable to do so in their current nonimmigrant status must first submit a COS application and request nonimmigrant student (F-1) status. These nonimmigrants must do so while they are still in lawful status.\n\n4. Other Nonimmigrants Seeking Change of Status to F-1 Classification\nSome nonimmigrant classifications (PDF) permit applicants to enroll in a full course of study incidental to their primary purpose for being in the United States, while other classifications do not. COS applicants in nonimmigrant classifications that permit such enrollment and who enroll in a full course of study may continue their studies, even if their COS to F-1 is approved more than 30 days before their program start date as listed on their Form I-20.[9]\n\nNonimmigrants whose classifications do not permit enrolling in a course of study must first acquire F-1 status and may only enroll in a full course of study upon the program start date listed on Form I-20.\n\nWhen an applicant applies for a COS to F-1 status, the applicant must wait until the COS is approved as well as 30 days before the new program start date before engaging in F status-specific activities (such as on-campus employment and practical training).[10]\n\n5. Travel Abroad and Consular Processing\nA nonimmigrant who obtains an F-1 nonimmigrant visa through consular processing may not be admitted more than 30 days before the report date or program start date listed on the Form I-20.[11] If a nonimmigrant travels abroad while their COS application is pending, USCIS considers that COS application abandoned.\n\nIf a nonimmigrant student travels abroad after USCIS has approved their F-1 COS application, regulations prohibit re-admission to the United States in F-1 status more than 30 days before the report date or program start date listed on the Form I-20.[12]\n\nB. Vocational Student (M-1) [Reserved]\n[Reserved]\n\nC. Extension of Stay\n1. F-1 Students\nAn F-1 student who is admitted for duration of status is not required to apply for an extension of stay with USCIS as long as the student is maintaining status and making normal progress toward completion of the student’s educational objective.[13] An F-2 dependent is not required to seek an extension of stay as long as the principal maintains F-1 student status.\n\nAn F-1 student who continues from one educational level to another is considered to be maintaining status, provided that the transition to the new educational level is completed according to the transfer procedures.[14] F-1 students continuing their studies at another educational level must request that the DSO change the students’ educational level within 60 days of their program end date.\n\nAn F-1 student who is maintaining status and making normal progress toward completing their educational objective, but is unable to complete their course of study by the program end date on the Form I-20, must request a program extension from their DSO before the program end date.\n\nThe F-1 student may be granted an extension if the DSO certifies that the student has continually maintained status and that the delay is caused by compelling academic or medical reasons, such as a change of major or research topics, unexpected research problems, or documented illnesses. Delays due to academic probation or suspension are not acceptable reasons for program extensions.\n\nAn F-2 dependent of an F-1 student unable to complete their course of study by the program end date on the Form I-20 does not need to apply separately for an extension of stay. If the DSO grants a program extension for the F-1 student, the DSO updates SEVIS for both the F-1 student and F-2 dependent.[15]\n\nFailure to receive timely authorization for extension of stay results in the loss of student status.[16] An F-1 student who is unable to complete the educational program within the time listed on the Form I-20 and who is ineligible for a program extension is considered out of status as of the program end date.[17] In either case, the student must request to be reinstated to student status to continue studies.[18]\n\nReinstatement to F-1 Student Status\n\nGenerally, USCIS may reinstate a student’s F-1 status if the student makes a request on an Application to Extend/Change Nonimmigrant Status (Form I-539). [19] The request must be accompanied by a properly completed Form I-20 indicating the DSO’s recommendation for reinstatement from the school the student is attending.[20]\n\nThe student’s application must show:\n\nThe student filed the application no more than 5 months after being out of status, or exceptional circumstances resulted in the student’s failure to file within 5 months and the request for reinstatement was filed as soon as possible under the circumstances;[21]\nThe student does not have a record of repeated or willful violations of DHS regulations;[22]\nThe student is currently pursuing or intending to pursue a full course of study in the immediate future at the school that issued the Form I‑20;[23]\nThe student has not engaged in unauthorized unemployment;[24] and\nThe student is not deportable on any ground other than as a noncitizen whose nonimmigrant status has been revoked or a noncitizen who has failed to maintain non",

M-1 Students\nThe cumulative time of extensions, including extensions for practical training, that can be granted to an M-1 student is limited to a period of 3 years from the M-1 student’s original start date, plus 30 days.\n\nNo extension can be granted to an M-1 student if the student is unable to complete the course of study within 3 years of the original program start date. This limit includes extensions that have been granted due to a drop below a full course of study, a transfer of schools, or reinstatement. M-1 students may be granted an extension of stay if they establish:\n\nThey are currently maintaining M-1 status;\nCompelling educational or medical reasons have resulted in a delay to their course of study (delays caused by academic probation or suspension are not acceptable reasons for program extension); and\nThey are able to, and in good faith intend to, continue to maintain that status for the period for which the extension is granted.[28]\nApplication\n\nAn M-1 student must apply to USCIS for an extension on Form I-539. The student must submit the application at least 15 days, but not more than 60 days, before the program end date on the student’s Form I-20. A student’s M-2 spouse and unmarried children under the age of 21 seeking an extension of stay may be included in the application. The application must also be accompanied by the student’s Form I-20 and the Form I-94 of the student’s spouse and unmarried children, if applicable.\n\nPeriod of Stay\n\nIf USCIS grants an application for extension, the M-1 student and their spouse and unmarried children under the age of 21 are given an extension of stay for the period of time necessary to complete the course of study, plus 30 days within which to depart from the United States, or for a total period of 1 year, whichever is less.[29]\n\nA student’s M-2 spouse and unmarred children under the age of 21 are not eligible for an extension unless USCIS grants the M-1 student an extension of stay, and USCIS does not grant them a longer period than USCIS grants the M-1 student.[30]\n\nReinstatement to M-1 Student Status\n\nUSCIS may consider reinstating a student who makes a request for reinstatement on a Form I-539, accompanied by a properly completed Form I-20 indicating the DSO’s recommendation for reinstatement. USCIS may consider granting the request only if the student:[31]\n\nHas not been out of status for more than 5 months at the time of filing the request for reinstatement (or demonstrates that the failure to file within the 5-month period was the result of exceptional circumstances and that the student filed the request for reinstatement as promptly as possible under these exceptional circumstances);\nDoes not have a record of repeated or willful violations of DHS regulations;\nIs currently pursuing, or intends to pursue, a full course of study at the school that issued the Form I-20;\nHas not engaged in unlawful employment;\nIs not deportable on any ground other than INA 237(a)(1)(B) or INA 237(a)(1)(C)(i); and\nProvides evidence that the violation of status resulted from circumstances beyond the student’s control[32] or the violation relates to a reduction in the student’s course load that would have been within a DSO’s power to authorize, and that failure to approve reinstatement would result in extreme hardship to the student.\nD. Length of Stay\nF-1 students may be admitted for a period of up to 30 days before the indicated report date or program start date listed on the Form I-20.[33] F-1 students are maintaining status if they are making normal progress toward completing a course of study. Admission, except for students enrolled in public high schools, is for duration of status.[34]\n\nM-1 students may be admitted for a period of up to 30 days before the report date or start date of the course of study listed on the Form I-20.\n\nM-1 students are admitted for a fixed time period, which is the period necessary to complete the course of study indicated on the Form I-20, plus any authorized practical training following completion of the course of study, plus an additional 30 days to depart the United States. However, the total time period may not exceed 1 year.[35]\n\nM-1 students are maintaining status if they are making normal progress toward completing a course of study.\n\nE.

You were recently paroled into the United States through the parole processes for nationals of Cuba, Haiti, Nicaragua, and Venezuela, or after receiving a CBP One App appointment and presenting at a Port of Entry; or\n2. You have applied for asylum by filing Form I-589, Application for Asylum and for Withholding of Removal, and your asylum application has been pending for at least 150 days.\n\nIf you have not already started the EAD application process, you can begin by creating a USCIS account online (https://myaccount.uscis.gov/create-account) and filing Form-I-765, Application for Employment Authorization (https://www.uscis.gov/i-765). We will mail your EAD to the address you provided in your EAD application if your Form I-765 is approved. \n\nCREATE AN ACCOUNT AND FILE ONLINE\nSubmitting your EAD application online provides helpful instructions and tips from USCIS as you complete your form using the secure online filing system (https://myaccount.uscis.gov/create-account). The system also helps you avoid common mistakes, such as leaving critical parts of the application blank or forgetting to sign your name, check case status (https://egov.uscis.gov/), and upload evidence. Be sure to review our How to Create a USCIS Online Account (https://www.uscis.gov/file-online/how-to-create-a-uscis-online-account) video for more information. Filing an application online is easier than you think. If necessary, you can file a paper application for Form I-765 instead of filing online.\n\nFILING FEES\nIf you have a pending Form I-589, there is no fee to file your initial Form I-765, but you may not file until 150 days after you submit your asylum application. You must submit the filing fee with a subsequent Form I-765 application.\nFor those individuals paroled into the U.S., there is also a filing fee. \nYou can find the filing fee for Form I-765 by visiting our Fee Schedule (https://www.uscis.gov/g-1055) page. You may apply for a fee waiver (https://www.uscis.gov/forms/filing-fees/additional-information-on-filing-a-fee-waiver) if you are unable to pay the filing fee. \n\nAPPLICATION DETAILS\nItems you will need to provide as evidence for your Form I-765 include:\n1. Either a copy of your stamped Form I-94, Arrival/Departure Record (front and back), a printout of your electronic Form I-94, a copy of your passport, or other travel document;\n2. A copy of your last EAD (if applicable);\n3. If you were not previously issued an EAD, a copy of a government-issued identity document; and\n4. Form G-28 (if you are represented by an attorney or accredited representative).\n\nIf you need to retrieve a copy your Form I-94, you may do so online by visiting U.S. Customs and Border Patrol’s I-94 webpage.\nIf you apply for an EAD, USCIS will notify you of the decision in writing. If your application is approved, we will either mail your EAD to you or we may require you to visit your local USCIS office to pick it up. If your address has changed, you must update it. You may do so through your USCIS online account (https://myaccount.uscis.gov/create-account) if you filed your form online or through the appropriate option listed in our Change of Address (https://www.uscis.gov/addresschange) page.",

Some statuses permit you to enroll in school, while other statuses do not. For example, the regulations at 8 C.F.R. § 214.2(b)(7) specifically prohibit a course of study in the United States while in B-1 or B-2 status. However, no such prohibition exists for those in E status, so individuals in that status can enroll in school as long as it does not interfere with their ability to maintain their E status.\n\nIndividuals in a nonimmigrant status that prohibits enrolling in school must first acquire F-1 (academic student) or M-1 (vocational student) status. Enrolling in a course of study while in a status that does not permit such activity will result in a status violation. Individuals who have violated their nonimmigrant status by enrolling in a course of study are not eligible to extend their status or change to F-1 or M-1 status.\n\nChanging to F or M Status from Another Nonimmigrant Status\nIf you are in the United States in valid nonimmigrant status for a purpose other than to attend school and wish to change your nonimmigrant status to a student status while remaining in the United States, you must meet the criteria below and submit an application with USCIS to change your status. \n\nIn general, you may apply to change your nonimmigrant status while remaining in the United States if:\n\nYou were lawfully admitted to the United States in a nonimmigrant status;\nYour nonimmigrant status remains valid;\nYou have not violated the conditions of your status; and\nYou have not committed any crimes or engaged in any other actions that would make you ineligible for change of status.\nUntil you receive notice of approval from USCIS, do not assume the requested status has been approved. Before USCIS may approve your application, you must take the following steps: \n\nApply to and receive acceptance from a U.S. Student and Exchange Visitor Program (SEVP)-certified school.\nObtain an initial Form I-20, Certificate of Eligibility for Nonimmigrant Student Status, from the SEVP-certified school. The Designated School Official (DSO) should give change of status in the Issue Reason section of the Form I-20.\nPay the I-901 SEVIS Fee.\nFile a Form I-539, Application to Extend/Change Nonimmigrant Status, with USCIS.\nNot all nonimmigrant classifications are allowed to change to student status. Read the Form I-539 instructions carefully to ensure that your category is eligible.\n\nWhat if My Current Status Doesn’t Allow Me to Enroll in Classes?\nIf you are requesting to change from another nonimmigrant status to F or M student status and your current nonimmigrant status does not permit you to enroll in classes, do not enroll in classes or begin your studies until USCIS has approved your change of status. If USCIS has not adjudicated your change of status at least 15 days before the program start date on your Form I-20, contact the designated school official (DSO) at your new school. If USCIS does not grant your request to change status prior to the start date of classes, you may need to defer attendance and wait until the following term in order to begin your studies at the school in F or M status.\n\nPlease note that if you are applying to change status to M status, you must maintain a valid nonimmigrant status while your Form I-539 change of status application is pending.\n\nWe encourage all students and prospective students to work closely with their DSO to coordinate the timing of applying for change of status and enrolling in a course of study.\n\nNOTE: If you are an M-1 student, you may not change to F status while you are in the United States.\n\nWhat if My Change of Status Application to F-1 Nonimmigrant Student is Still Pending Within 30 Days of My F-1 Program Start Date?\nDue to processing times, you may have to request that your DSO defer the F-1 program start date to the following academic term or semester because USCIS did not make a decision on your Form I-539 change of status application before your originally intended F-1 program start date. If your COS application is approved, your change of status to F-1 will be effective as of the date of approval. You are not required to obtain status all the way up to the date that is 30 days before your program start date (“bridge the gap”), provided that your nonimmigrant status is unexpired at the time of filing the change of status to F-1 application, and you otherwise remain eligible for a change of status.\n\nWhat if My Change of Status Application to F-1 Nonimmigrant Student is Approved More than 30 Days Before My F-1 Program Start Date?\nIf we approve an application more than 30 days before your program start date, you must ensure that you do not violate your F-1 status. An example of a violation would be engaging in employment, including on-campus employment and practical training, more than 30 days before the program start date as listed on your Form I-20.\n\nWhat if my Change of Status Application to M-1 Nonimmigrant Student is Still Pending within 30 Days of My M-1 Program Start Date?\nIf your current nonimmigrant status will expire more than 30 days before your M-1 program start date and you wish to remain in the United States until your start date, you must find a way to obtain status all the way up to the date that is",

If you do not file this separate request before your status expires, USCIS will deny your Form I-539 request to change to M-1 status. Please continue to check the USCIS processing times while your Form I-539 change of status request is pending to determine if you need to file a request to extend or change your nonimmigrant status. \n\nNote that because of processing times, you may have to request that your DSO defer the M-1 program start date to the following term or semester because USCIS did not make a decision on your Form I-539 change of status application before your originally intendedM-1 program start date. In that instance, you will need to obtain status all the way up to the date which is 30 days before your new program start date. If you had already filed an I-539 to bridge the original gap, you may need to file another I-539 to bridge the new gap.\nBecause extending or changing nonimmigrant status to bridge the gap and changing to M-1 status are two distinct benefits, you must pay a separate filing fee for each request. See the User Fee Statute, 31 U.S.C. § 9701. \n\nLeaving the United States to Become an F-1 or M-1 Student\nYou may consider consular processing if you are concerned about maintaining your nonimmigrant status to within 30 days of your M-1 program start date (which may be deferred as described above) or are otherwise not eligible to change status to F-1 or M-1 status in the United States. You will need to do the following:\n\nApply to and receive acceptance from a SEVP-certified school.\nReceive a new initial Form I-20 from your designated school official (DSO).\nPay the I-901 SEVIS fee.\nApply at a U.S. consulate or embassy for an F-1 or M-1 visa to travel to the United States in order to seek admission as a student.\nIf you are from a country where no visa is required, such as Canada, you may proceed directly to a U.S. port of entry or a U.S. pre-clearance/pre-flight inspection station and apply for admission to the United States as an F-1 or M-1 student.\nOnce admitted by an immigration officer in F-1 or M-1 status, you may begin your studies.",

The calculator will also determine your auto-extended EAD expiration date.\nYou will need your current EAD (expired or unexpired) and Form I-797C, Notice of Action, receipt notice of your form I-765 to use the calculator. If you are filing under employment authorization Category Codes A17, A18, or C26, you will also need your unexpired Form I-94.\n\nHow the calculator works:\nThe automatic extension begins on the day after the “Card Expires” date on the front of the EAD and generally continues for up to 540 days. The extension ends when the applicant receives a final decision on their renewal application or when the 540-day period expires, whichever comes earlier.\nFor expired or expiring EADs with category codes A17, A18, and C26, to calculate the new expiration date:\n1. Add 540 days to the EAD “Card Expires” date.\n2. Compare the 540-day auto-extended date to the Form I-94 end date.\n3. Whichever date is earlier is the auto-extended EAD expiration date.\n\nDisclaimer: This calculator is intended to help individuals determine the new EAD expiration date for a person who is eligible for an automatic extension of their expiring EAD based on a temporary final rule (https://www.uscis.gov/newsroom/news-releases/uscis-increases-automatic-extension-of-certain-employment-authorization-documents-to-improve-access) that amends 8 CFR 274a.13(d). The calculator does not replace an employer’s legal requirement to verify employment eligibility for their new or existing employees in accordance with the Form I-9, Employment Eligibility Verification process. Government agencies that issue public benefits/licenses and that are registered to use SAVE should use SAVE to verify EAD validity periods, including any automatic extensions.\n\nProof of an EAD Automatic Extension\nAn employer or government agency may require proof that an EAD has been automatically extended. Renewal applicants eligible for an EAD automatic extension are responsible for presenting documentation to show they continue to have employment authorization.\nA facially expired EAD is still valid when presented with a Form I-797C, Notice of Action, Receipt Notice extending its validity period. To show that the “Card Expires” date shown on your EAD has been automatically extended, you must present:\n1. Your current EAD (expired or unexpired) with an eligible category for automatic extension\nNote: If the code on your EAD is A17, A18, or C26, you must also show your unexpired Form I-94.\nAND\n2. Form I-797C, Notice of Action, receipt notice showing that you timely filed to renew your EAD in the same category eligible for automatic extension. The receipt notice must:\n   a. Be dated with a “Received Date” that is on or after May 4, 2022 through Sept. 30, 2025; and\n   b. Refers to the 180-day or 540-day extension.\nNOTE: If you filed Form I-765 based on a grant of TPS or a pending TPS application, please see the Temporary Protected Status (TPS) section below for more information on TPS-specific requirements for the automatic EAD extension.\n\nThis document combination is acceptable proof of an up-to-540-day automatic extension under the May 2022 temporary final rule (https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2022/05/04/2022-09539/",

These filings also qualify for the up to 540-day automatic extension. We will not issue updated Form I-797C notices for these filings. Individuals should refer to this webpage to confirm eligibility requirements for the up to 540-day automatic extension.\nYou may refer your employer to this website if they have any questions. Government agencies issuing benefits or licenses that rely on EADs as identity documents may also refer to this webpage.\n\nEAD Temporary Final Rules \nOn April 4, 2024, USCIS published a temporary final rule that increased the automatic extension period for employment authorization or EADs available to certain EAD renewal applicants from up to 180 days to up to 540 days.\n\nThis temporary final rule applies to two categories of EAD renewal applicants:\n1. Applicants who timely and properly filed their Form I-765 applications on or after Oct. 27, 2023, if the application was still pending on April 8, 2024; and\n2. Applicants who timely and properly file their Form I-765 application from April 8, 2024, through Sept. 30, 2025.\n\nPreviously, in May 2022, USCIS published (https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2022/05/04/2022-09539/temporary-increase-of-the-automatic-extension-period-of-employment-authorization-and-documentation) a temporary final rule that increased the automatic EAD extension period for certain EAD renewal applicants from up to 180 days to up to 540 days. As announced in 2022, this temporary final rule was applicable to applications filed during a limited period that ended Oct. 26, 2023.\nBecause the 2024 temporary final rule provides a 540-day auto-extension for those who filed after the filing period under the 2022 temporary final rule ended, there is no gap in the 540-day auto-extension increase for eligible renewal applications timely filed on or after May 4, 2022, through September 2025. Therefore, for the convenience of the public, we are combining the filing periods of the two temporary final rules in this guidance.\nIf you receive an up-to-540-day automatic extension under either the 2024 temporary final rule or the 2022 temporary final rule, the automatic extension will generally end when we make a decision on your EAD renewal application, or at the end of the 540-day period, whichever comes earlier.\n\nTemporary Protected Status (TPS)\nTPS applicants and beneficiaries may have their TPS-based EAD automatically extended by 1 of the following automatic EAD extensions, if they qualify:\n1. If you have a TPS-based EAD and maintain TPS, you may receive an up-to-540-day automatic extension of your EAD through the automatic EAD extension described on this page.\n    You qualify for this automatic extension if:\n    a. You filed your renewal Form I-765 application during the TPS re-registration period indicated in the applicable Federal Register notice for your country;\n    b. The Form I-797C, Notice of Action, indicating receipt of your Form I-765 has a “Received Date” from May 4, 2022, through Sept. 30, 2025;\n    c. Your Form I-765 application is for eligibility category (a)(12) or (c)(19); and\n    d. The category on your current EAD is A12 or C19. The categories on your renewal application and expired EAD do not need to match. (For example, you will still qualify for the automatic extension if your expired EAD says C19 and your renewal application says A12.)\n\nIf you meet the above criteria, the new expiration date of your EAD is up to 540 days past the “Card Expires” date shown on your EAD. Your facially expired or expiring EAD and Form I-797C, Notice of Action, receipt notice, will serve as acceptable proof of identity and employment authorization during the automatic extension period.\n2. TPS-based EADs may also be automatically extended through publication of a Federal Register notice unique to your country of origin. You may receive an automatic EAD extension through publication of one of these Federal Register notices if you maintain TPS and meet the eligibility requirements for that extension. Your facially expired EAD will serve as acceptable proof of identity and employment authorization during this automatic extension period.

The individual notice automatically extends the EAD to the specific date stated in the notice. To show your employer that your EAD is automatically extended by an individual notice for Form I-9 purposes, you will need to present the individual notice with your facially expired or expiring EAD.\n\n\nYou may qualify for more than 1 of these automatic extensions. If you are eligible for more than 1 extension, you may show your employer documentation for the extension that will extend your employment authorization to the furthest date in the future. You cannot add the extensions together to increase the time; you can only use 1. To determine which automatic extension benefits you most:\n1.

You may wish to consult with an attorney to determine the best option for you.\n\nKey Questions to Consider When Choosing an Entrepreneur Pathway\n\nAm I required to make an investment or have an ownership interest in the start-up?\nSome pathways, such as the International Entrepreneur Rule (https://www.uscis.gov/working-in-the-united-states/international-entrepreneur-rule), require you to have a certain amount of ownership in the start-up entity. Other pathways, such as E-2 Treaty Investor (https://www.uscis.gov/working-in-the-united-states/temporary-workers/e-2-treaty-investors) or EB-5 Immigrant Investor (https://www.uscis.gov/working-in-the-united-states/permanent-workers/eb-5-immigrant-investor-program), require you invest. For some pathways, you may be an owner or investor, but it is not required.\n\nAm I required to have a certain role or position in the start-up entity?\nSome pathways require that you have a certain role or position in the start-up entity. The International Entrepreneur Rule requires you to have a central and active role in operations. E-2 requires you to have the capacity to develop and direct the enterprise. L-1A Intracompany Transferee Executive or Manager (https://www.uscis.gov/working-in-the-united-states/temporary-workers/l-1a-intracompany-transferee-executive-or-manager) requires you to be in a managerial or executive position. H-1B Specialty Occupation (https://www.uscis.gov/working-in-the-united-states/h-1b-specialty-occupations) requires you to work in a specialty occupation related to your degree. Other pathways, such as the O-1A (https://www.uscis.gov/working-in-the-united-states/temporary-workers/o-1-visa-individuals-with-extraordinary-ability-or-achievement) nonimmigrant classification or the EB-1A (https://www.uscis.gov/working-in-the-united-states/permanent-workers/employment-based-immigration-first-preference-eb-1) first-preference immigrant visa classification, are for individuals with extraordinary ability and require you to continue to work in your field of expertise. Additional pathways are discussed in detail below.\n\nWhat are the requirements for the start-up entity?\nSome pathways have requirements for the start-up entity. For example, the International Entrepreneur Rule requires the entity to lawfully conduct business in the United States and to have been formed within the five years immediately preceding the initial application. It must also have substantial potential for rapid growth and job creation. The L-1 nonimmigrant visa classification requires the new office to have a qualifying relationship (parent, subsidiary, or affiliate) with a foreign business that employed you abroad for at least one year. Additional requirements are discussed in detail below.\n\nDo I have the education, experience, or skills needed to qualify?\nSome pathways, such as the O-1A nonimmigrant visa classification and the EB-1A immigrant visa classification, are for those with “extraordinary ability.” These require that a person have sustained national or international acclaim in their field of expertise. Others, such as the H-1B, require at least a U.S. bachelor’s degree in a specific specialty or its equivalent related to the position.\n\nWill I be working in the United States on a permanent basis as a lawful permanent resident, or will I be working on a temporary basis as a parolee or nonimmigrant?\nSome opportunities provide a basis for individuals to obtain lawful permanent resident status in the United States. Permanent resident status allows you to live and work in the United States permanently, and typically provides you with a path to U.S. citizenship. These opportunities are known as “immigrant” pathways.\nOther pathways, such as parole or nonimmigrant status, allow you to temporarily live and work in the United States. Although some of these nonimmigrant pathways cannot be extended indefinitely, they can provide more time to demonstrate eligibility for a permanent resident pathway.\n\nSummary of Pathways for Entrepreneur Employment in the United States\nNonimmigrant or Parole (Temporary) Pathways\nFor more details, see our Nonimmigrant or Parole (Temporary) Pathways for Entrepreneur Employment in the United States (https://www.uscis.gov/working-in-the-united-states/entrepreneur-employment-pathways/nonimmigrant-or-parole-pathways-for-entrepreneur-employment-in-the-un",

Designated school oﬀicials (DSO) at certified schools issue Form I-20, Certificate of Eligibility for Nonimmigrant (F-1)/(M-1) Students. Foreign academic or vocational students may work in the United States under certain circumstances. DHS issues documents showing employment authorization based on the type of student they are and the type of employment they have.\n\nAcademic Students in F-1 Nonimmigrant Status\nF-1 students may not work off-campus during the first academic year but may accept on-campus employment subject to certain conditions and restrictions. After the first academic year, F-1 students may seek off-campus employment through a variety of programs. The following table shows where students can locate their “Authorized to Work Until” date for Section 1, as well as the types of documents they may receive and could present to you for Form I-9 purposes.\n\n\nF-1 Employment Type: On campus\nStudents: Where to Find Your “Authorized to work until” Date for Section 1: Form I-20, Certificate of Eligibility for Nonimmigrant Student Status, program end date\nEmployers: Section 2 Acceptable Documents: Unexpired foreign passport and Form I-94, Arrival/Departure Record (Or) List B and List C document (unexpired Form I-94)\n\nF-1 Employment Type: Curricular practical training (CPT)\nStudents: Where to Find Your “Authorized to work until” Date for Section 1: Form I-20, Certificate of Eligibility for Nonimmigrant Student Status, CPT end date from the employment authorization field\nEmployers: Section 2 Acceptable Documents: Employers: Section 2 Acceptable Documents: Unexpired foreign passport, Form I-94, and Form I-20 (Or) List B and List C documents (unexpired Form I-94 with Form I-20)\n\nF-1 Employment Type: Off campus, severe economic hardship\nStudents: Where to Find Your “Authorized to work until” Date for Section 1: Form I-766, Employment Authorization Document (EAD) “Card Expires” date\nEmployers: Section 2 Acceptable Documents: EAD\n\nF-1 Employment Type: Off campus, sponsored by an international organization\nStudents: Where to Find Your “Authorized to work until” Date for Section 1: Form I-766, Employment Authorization Document (EAD) “Card Expires” date\nEmployers: Section 2 Acceptable Documents: EAD\n\nF-1 Employment Type: Optional practical training (OPT)\nStudents: Where to Find Your “Authorized to work until” Date for Section 1: Form I-766, Employment Authorization Document (EAD) “Card Expires” date\nEmployers: Section 2 Acceptable Documents: EAD\n\nF-1 Employment Type: OPT science, technology, engineering, and math (STEM)\nStudents: Where to Find Your “Authorized to work until” Date for Section 1: Form I-766, Employment Authorization Document (EAD) “Card Expires” date\nEmployers: Section 2 Acceptable Documents: EAD\n\nF-1 Employment Type: STEM OPT extension\nStudents: Where to Find Your “Authorized to work until” Date for Section 1: Form I-766, Employment Authorization Document (EAD) “Card Expires” date (Or) Expired EAD “Card Expires” date plus 180 days.\nEmployers: Section 2 Acceptable Documents: EAD or Expired EAD* with Form I-20 endorsed by a designated school official for STEM extension.\n\nF-1 Employment Type: Cap-gap F-1 with pending H-1B petition\nStudents: Where to Find Your “Authorized to work until” Date for Section 1: Enter Sept. 30 and the year the H‑1B petition was filed.\nEmployers: Section 2 Acceptable Documents: Form I-766, Employment Authorization Document (EAD) and Form I-797C, Notice of Action for Form I-129, Petition for a Nonimmigrant Worker\n\n*In limited circumstances, employers may accept an EAD that appears to be expired for Form I-9 verification. See F-1 STEM OPT Extension below.\n\n\nOn-Campus Employment\nSubject to certain conditions, F-1 students may work on campus without approval from USCIS until they complete their course of study. The F-1 nonimmigrant admission notation on their Form I-94 usually states “D/S” indicating duration of status. The F-1 student’s Form I-20 provides a Program End Date field, which is the latest date they can complete the academic program stated on the Form I-20 . The student must enter the program end date in Section 1 as the date employment authorization expires.\n\nIn Section 2, you may enter:\n1. A List A document, including the combination of:\n   a. A foreign passport; and\n   b. Form I-94 indicating F-1 nonimmigrant status\n\nor\n\n2. List B and List C documents:\n   a.

For example, a state driver’s license (List B document) and, under List C #7, a Form I-94 indicating F-1 nonimmigrant status. \n\nWe do not require you to record information from the student’s Form I-20 in Section 2 for on-campus employment.\n\nF-1 students may work:\n1. On the school’s premises, including on-location commercial firms that provide services for students on campus, such as the school bookstore or cafeteria; and\n2. At an oﬀ-campus location that is educationally aﬀiliated with the school.\n\nEmployment that does not provide direct services to students is not on-campus employment. For example, an on-campus commercial firm, such as a construction company that builds a school building, does not provide direct student services. Guidelines for on-campus employment are available at ice.gov/sevis/employment.\n\nOn-campus employment is limited to 20 hours a week when school is in session. An exception to this limitation applies in cases of emergent circumstances that DHS announces in a Federal Register notice.\n\nCurricular Practical Training\nCurricular practical training (CPT) allows students to accept paid alternative work/study, internship, cooperative education, or any other type of required internship or practicum that sponsoring employers oﬀer through cooperative agreements with the school. The CPT program must be an integral part of the student’s degree program curriculum. The DSO must authorize CPT on the student’s Form I-20. The student should enter the CPT employment end date from the employment authorization section of their Form I-20 in Section 1 as the date employment authorization expires.\n\nIn Section 2, you may enter:\n1. A List A document, including the combination of:\n   a. A foreign passport;\n   b. Form I-94 indicating F-1 nonimmigrant status; and\n   c. Form I-20 with the DSO endorsement for employment\n\nor\n\n2. List B and List C documents:\n   a. For example, a state driver’s license (List B document) and, under List C #7, a Form I-94 indicating F-1 nonimmigrant status with a properly endorsed Form I-20. You should enter the additional List C document in the Additional Information box.\n\nAn acceptable Form I-20 for CPT must have all Employment Authorization fields completed. These fields include employment status, employment type, start and end date of employment, and the employer’s name and location. Use the CPT Employment End Date on Form I-20 as the expiration date in Section 2.\n\nBorder commuter students who enter the United States as an F-1 nonimmigrant may only work as part of their CPT or post-completion OPT.\n\nOptional Practical Training (OPT) for F-1 Students – EAD Required\nOPT provides practical training experience that directly relates to an F-1 nonimmigrant’s major area of study on the Form I-20. An F-1 student authorized for OPT may work up to 20 hours per week while school is in session and full-time when school is not in session. After completing their degree program, USCIS may authorize an F-1 student up to 12 months of OPT. Certain F-1 students may be eligible to extend their OPT; see F-1 STEM OPT Extension below for more information.\n\nThe designated school oﬀicial must update Form I-20 to indicate an OPT recommendation. F-1 students must obtain an EAD from USCIS before they are authorized to work pursuant to OPT. The student may not begin employment until the date indicated on the EAD. The EAD establishes the student’s identity and employment authorization for Form I-9 purposes.\n\nWhen completing Section 1, the student must enter the EAD Card Expires date in the Authorized to Work Until field in Section 1. When completing Section 2 for this student, you should enter the EAD’s card number and Card Expires date under List A. When the student’s EAD expires, you must reverify the student’s employment authorization using Supplement B, Reverification and Rehire.\n\nF-1 STEM OPT Extension\nAn F-1 student who received a bachelor’s, master’s, or doctoral degree in science, technology, engineering, or mathematics from an accredited and Student and Exchange Visitor Program (SEVP)-certified school may apply for a 24-month extension of their OPT before their current OPT employment authorization expires. Employment must be directly related to their major area of study, and you must be enrolled in and be in good standing with E-Verify.\n\nYour E-Verify company identification number is required for the student to apply to USCIS for the STEM extension using Form I-765, Application for Employment Authorization. A STEM student may change employers or work at a diﬀerent hiring site for the same employer, but any new employer or new hiring site must be enrolled in and be in good standing with E-Verify before the student begins employment. Moreover, new employers or hiring sites must timely report any change in the student’s employment information, as described below.\n\nThe EAD issued to the F-1 STEM OPT student states “STU: STEM OPT ONLY.” The following documents establish a student’s identity and employment authorization for Form I-9:\n1. An unexpired EAD; or\n2. An expired EAD presented with Form I-20 endorsed by the student’s designated school oﬀicial recommending a STEM extension if the student timely filed their Form I-765 but their application is still pending.

Reporting a student’s termination of employment or departure to the DSO within five business days.\n\nAdditional requirements and information on your responsibilities are available at studyinthestates.dhs.gov.\n\nCap-Gap\nThe term “cap-gap” refers to the period between the time a nonimmigrant’s F-1 student status would ordinarily end and their H-1B status begins. F-1 students who seek to change to H-1B status may be eligible for a cap-gap extension of status and employment authorization through Sept. 30 of the calendar year you filed Form I- 129, Petition for Nonimmigrant Worker (H-1B petition) but only if the student’s H-1B status begins on Oct. 1.\n\nIf you employ an F-1 nonimmigrant student in OPT and you timely filed an H-1B petition for that student, they may be able to continue working beyond the expiration date on their OPT EAD while waiting for the start date of an approved or pending H-1B petition.\n\nThere are two types of cap-gap extensions:\n1. Extensions of F-1 status only (without OPT): If a student is in F-1 status when you file an H-1B petition with an Oct. 1 start date, but the student is not currently participating in OPT, they will receive a cap-gap extension of their F-1 status but will not be authorized to work until we approve the petition and their H-1B status begins on Oct. 1.\n2. Extensions of F-1 status and OPT: If a student is in F-1 status when you file an H-1B petition with an Oct. 1 start date and is currently participating in post-completion OPT, they will receive an automatic cap-gap extension of both their F-1 student status and their authorized period of post-completion OPT. If we select their petition and it remains pending or we approve it, the student will remain authorized to work as an F-1 student with OPT through Sept. 30.\n\nCap-Gap Automatic Extension Based on Timely Requests to Change Status\n\nFor an eligible F-1 student to receive an automatic EAD extension, you must:\n1. Timely file a petition to change the student’s status to H-1B; and\n2. State the student’s employment start date is Oct. 1 of the year you filed the H-1B petition.\n\nThe employee’s expired EAD in combination with your Form I-797C, Notice of Action, showing the above requirements is an unexpired EAD under List A. This automatic extension ends if the H-1B petition is rejected, denied, revoked, or withdrawn.\n\nTimely filed means you submitted the H-1B petition (indicating change of status rather than consular processing) during the acceptance period while the student’s authorized F-1 duration of status admission was still in eﬀect. This includes any period of time during the academic course of study, any authorized periods of post completion OPT, and the 60-day departure preparation period.\n\nIn Section 1, a new employee should:\n1.

VIBE uses commercially available data from an independent information provider (IIP) to validate basic information about companies or organizations petitioning to employ certain noncitizens and to validate the basic information about the companies or organizations listed on:\n1. Form I-129, Petition for a Nonimmigrant Worker; (https://www.uscis.gov/i-129)\n2. Form I-140, Immigrant Petition for Alien Worker; (https://www.uscis.gov/i-140)\n3. Form I-360, Petition for Amerasian, Widow(er), or Special Immigrant; (https://www.uscis.gov/i-360) and \n4. Form I-485 Supplement J, Confirmation of Bona Fide Job Offer or Request for Job Portability Under INA Section 204(j) (https://www.uscis.gov/i-485supj).\n\nFor additional information, please visit the VIBE Questions and Answers (https://www.uscis.gov/working-in-the-united-states/information-for-employers-and-employees/employer-information/vibe/vibe-questions-and-answers) page.\nCurrently, Dun and Bradstreet (D&B) is the independent information provider for the VIBE program.\n\nBackground\nWhen adjudicating employment-based petitions or applications, USCIS must primarily rely on paper documentation supplied by the petitioning company or organization to establish the petitioner’s eligibility for the requested classification or by the applicant to confirm a bona fide job offer or request job portability.\nWhen the paperwork does not sufficiently document the evidence required under the law, USCIS must issue a Request for Evidence (RFE) for additional documentation, delaying final adjudication of the petition or application.\nThe VIBE program has been introduced to address some of these issues.\n\nVIBE Program\nVIBE allows USCIS to electronically receive commercially available information from an IIP, currently D&B, about a company or an organization. This information includes:\n1. Business activities, such as type of business (North American Industry Classification System code), trade payment information, and status (active or inactive)\n2. Financial standing, including sales volume and credit standing\n3. Number of employees, both on-site and globally\n4. Relationships with other entities, including foreign affiliates\n5. Type of office (examples include single entities, branches, subsidiaries and headquarters)\n6. Type of legal entity (for example, LLC, partnership or corporation)\n7. Company executives\n8. Date of establishment as a business entity\n9. Current physical address\n\nUSCIS officers review all information received through VIBE along with the evidence submitted by the petitioner or applicant and will use the information from VIBE to verify the petitioner’s qualifications. For example, if a petitioner is seeking L-1 status for a beneficiary, VIBE will help USCIS officers confirm that the petitioner has a foreign affiliate, which is a requirement for granting L-1 status. They will also use the information from VIBE to validate the bona fides of the employer when certain employment-based applicants file for lawful permanent resident status.\nInformation from VIBE will also help to confirm an employer's financial viability and operational status for petitions and applications where a job offer is required. USCIS will not deny a petition or an application solely based upon information from VIBE. If USCIS officers find significant data discrepancy between the evidence submitted by the petitioner or applicant and the information presented in VIBE, they will give the petitioner or applicant the opportunity to respond to the agency’s concerns. USCIS may issue an RFE or a Notice of Intent to Deny (NOID) if it is necessary to resolve relevant inconsistencies or other issues that emerge upon review of VIBE-supplied information that are material to the benefit requested.\nUSCIS will then make a final decision based on the totality of the circumstances.\n\nYour Company’s or Organization’s Information in VIBE\nUSCIS does not require companies and organizations to create or update records with D&B; however, you may choose to create, verify, or correct your company or organization’s information with D&B.\nIf your entity is a U.S.-based privately held company or organization and you would like to create, verify or correct its D&B record, you may contact D&B directly online through iUpdate for U.S. government customers (https://www.dnb.com/duns/duns-number-and-government.html). Contacting D&B through this link will allow you to create, update and view basic elements of your company’s or organization’s D&B report without being subjected to direct marketing from D&B. It is only available for U.S.-based privately held companies and other U.S. government customers.\niUpdate for U.S. government customers is a free, password-protected and encrypted online service tool offered by D&B. Its users will be asked a series of short challenge questions, based on geographical and demographic data, to authenticate and establish an ID and password. Only those with access to your established ID and password will be able to access your business information.\nIf you are a U.S.-based publicly traded company, government entity, or foreign company and you want to create, update or view your report with D&B, you may use dnb.com.  \nPlease be aware that if you update your information through dnb.com, you may be subjected to direct marketing from D&B.

SD1, minister of religion\n2. SR1, non-minister in a religious occupation or vocation\n\nNonimmigrant Classifications Included in VIBE\nThe following Form I-129, Petition for a Nonimmigrant Worker, employment-based nonimmigrant classifications are also included in VIBE:\n1.

TN, NAFTA professional from Canada or Mexico\n\nI-485 Supplement J Included in VIBE\nWhen an applicant files Form I-485 Supplement J to confirm a bona fide job offer or to request job portability under INA section 204(j), USCIS will use VIBE to validate the basic information about the companies or organizations listed on the Form I-485 Supplement J. However, if the employer is listed as “Self/Individual” on the Form I-485 Supplement J, USCIS will not use VIBE because an individual’s information is not included in VIBE.\n\nClassifications Not Included in VIBE\nDue to their unique eligibility requirements, the following employment-based classifications are not included in VIBE at this time:\n1. CW-1, Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands (CNMI)-only transitional worker\n2. E-2C, long-term foreign investors in the CNMI\n3. E11, individuals of extraordinary ability\n4. E21, national interest waiver\n5. EB-5, immigrant investor\n6. O, individuals with extraordinary ability or achievement (including essential support personnel)\n7. P, internationally recognized athletes and entertainment groups, performers under a reciprocal exchange program, and artists or entertainers under a culturally unique program (including essential support personnel)\n\nGoals of VIBE\nThe use of VIBE is expected to enhance USCIS’ ability to distinguish eligible petitioners and applicants from those who may be ineligible, and thus make reviews by USCIS officers more efficient.\nThe use of VIBE should reduce the need for companies and organizations to submit identical paper documentation with each petition to establish their current level of business operations. Through VIBE, USCIS should also be able to reduce the number of RFEs issued to otherwise eligible petitioners or applicants.\nBy providing the same petitioner and applicant information to all five USCIS service centers, VIBE promotes the consistent review of employment-based immigrant and nonimmigrant filings. Overall, the information VIBE provides improves the integrity of employment-based immigrant and nonimmigrant programs and the process for petitioners seeking foreign workers to employ.\n\nFeedback about VIBE\nUSCIS may send to some petitioners or applicants an RFE or NOID that references information VIBE has received from the IIP. Petitioners or applicants MUST respond to these RFEs or NOIDs; failure to respond may result in the denial of the petition or application.\nCustomers may email to USCIS their questions about RFEs or NOIDs involving IIP information we received through VIBE, as well as suggestions for improving the program, to VIBE-Feedback@dhs.gov.",

USCIS will update Form I-941, Application for Entrepreneur Parole, and its instructions to reflect these updated amounts in the near future.\n\nBy regulation, the investment and revenue amounts must be automatically adjusted every three years by the Consumer Price Index for All Urban Consumers (CPI-U) and posted on the USCIS website. In a final rule (https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2024/07/25/2024-16138/international-entrepreneur-program-fiscal-year-2025-automatic-increase-of-investment-and-revenue) published on July 25, 2024, DHS calculated the new investment and revenue amounts and revised the applicable provisions to adjust for inflation. The new amounts will take effect at the start of fiscal year 2025, which begins on Oct. 1, 2024. As explained in the 2024 final rule:\n1. If relying on an investment from a qualifying investor, the amount is increasing from $264,147 to $311,071.\n2. If relying on a government award or grant, the amount is increasing from $105,659 to $124,429.\n3. The revenue amount for consideration of re-parole is increasing from $528,293 to $622,142.\n4. An individual or organization may be a qualified investor if they made investments in start-up entities comprising a total of no less than $746,571 (rather than $633,952) in a specified 5-year period and, subsequent to those investments, at least two of those entities have each created at least five jobs or generated at least $622,142 (rather than $528,293) in revenue with annualized revenue growth of at least 20%.\n\nFor more information, see the Federal Register notice (https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2024/07/25/2024-16138/international-entrepreneur-program-fiscal-year-2025-automatic-increase-of-investment-and-revenue). \n\nUnder the International Entrepreneur Rule (https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2017/01/17/2017-00481/international-entrepreneur-rule) (IER), the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) may use its authority to grant a period of authorized stay, on a case-by-case basis, to noncitizen entrepreneurs who show that their stay in the United States would provide a significant public benefit through their business venture and that they merit a favorable exercise of discretion. This period of authorized stay is called “parole.”\nUnder this rule, entrepreneurs granted parole will be eligible to work only for their startup business. The spouse and children of the noncitizen entrepreneur may also be eligible for parole.\nThreshold criteria and key elements of the International Entrepreneur Rule include:\n1. Entrepreneurs may be either living abroad or already in the United States.\n2. Startup entities must have been formed in the United States within the past five years.\n3. Startup entities must show substantial potential for rapid growth and job creation by showing at least $311,071 in qualified investments from qualifying investors, at least $124,429 in qualified government awards or grants, or alternative evidence.\n4. The spouse of the entrepreneur may apply for employment authorization after being paroled into the United States. (Children are not eligible for employment authorization.)\n5. The entrepreneur may be granted an initial parole period of up to 2.5 years. If approved for re-parole, based on additional benchmarks in funding, job creation, or revenue described below, the entrepreneur may receive up to another 2.5 years, for a maximum of 5 years. (At that point or earlier, there are other Options for Noncitizen Entrepreneurs to Work in the United States (https://www.uscis.gov/working-in-the-united-states/options-for-noncitizen-entrepreneurs-to-work-in-the-united-states).)\n6. Up to 3 entrepreneurs per startup can be eligible for parole under the International Entrepreneur Rule.\n\nSee the drop-down menus below for more detailed information and frequently asked questions (FAQs) for each section.

It must also have substantial potential for rapid growth and job creation.\n\nWhat type and level of funding are required to demonstrate that the startup entity has the substantial potential for rapid growth and job creation?\nYou must be able to document that, within the past 18 months, the entity received the following funding:\n1. A qualified investment of at least the required amount from a qualifying investor ($311,071 as of Oct. 1, 2024);\n2. A qualified award or grant of at least the required amount from a U.S. federal, state, or local government entity ($124,429 as of Oct. 1, 2024); or\n3. Alternatively, if the startup entity partially meets one or both above funding levels, you may submit additional reliable and compelling evidence of the startup entity’s substantial potential for rapid growth and job creation.\n\nWhile nothing precludes you from personally investing in the startup entity or otherwise securing additional funding, only qualified investments from a qualifying investor count towards the minimum investment amount.\n\nA qualified investor:\n1. Is an individual who is a U.S. citizen or lawful permanent resident of the United States, or an organization located in the United States and that operates through a legal entity organized under the laws of the United States or any state, that is majority owned and controlled, directly and indirectly, by U.S. citizens or lawful permanent residents of the United States;\n2.

After such investment by such individual or organization, at least two such entities each created at least 5 qualified jobs or generated revenue of at least a certain amount ($622,142 as of Oct. 1, 2024), with average annualized revenue growth of at least 20%.\n\nA qualified investor is not:\n1. You or any of your immediate relatives;\n2. An organization you or your immediate relatives have a direct or indirect ownership interest in;\n3.

Barred from association with any entity involved in the offer or sale of securities or provision of such services; or\n5. Otherwise found to have participated in the offer or sale of securities or provision of such services in violation of law.\n\nA qualified investment means a purchase from a startup entity of its equity, convertible debt, or other security convertible into its equity commonly used in financing transactions in such entity's industry.\nWe have also published comprehensive guidance on the International Entrepreneur Rule (https://www.uscis.gov/policy-manual/volume-3-part-g) in our Policy Manual.\n\nCan my spouse and children accompany me to the United States?\nYour spouse and children (unmarried, minor child under 21 years of age) can also apply for parole by filing Form I-131, Application for Travel Documents, Parole Documents, and Arrival/Departure Records (https://www.uscis.gov/i-131), either when you file your Form I-941, or after you file it.\n\nCan my spouse work in the United States?\nSpouses of noncitizens, after being paroled into the United States under the International Entrepreneur Rule, may apply for employment authorization by filing Form I-765, Application for Employment Authorization (https://www.uscis.gov/i-765).\n\nWhat is the maximum time I may remain in the United States under the International Entrepreneur Rule?\nYou may be granted an initial period of parole for up to 2.5years. If approved for a new period of parole (also known as re-parole), you may receive another period of parole for up to 2.5 years, for a maximum of 5 years.\n\nWhat is the maximum time I may remain in the United States under the International Entrepreneur Rule?\nYou may be granted an initial period of parole for up to 2.5years.

However, as parole is not admission, you would generally be ineligible for adjustment or change of status while in the United States. As a result, if your nonimmigrant or immigrant petition is approved, you may have to depart the United States to apply for a visa based on the petition approval (unless visa exempt) before traveling to a port of entry to request admission into the United States as an immigrant or nonimmigrant, as applicable.\n\nCan I apply if I am in nonimmigrant status, such as B-1 or F-1? Can I apply if I have overstayed the term of my nonimmigrant status, but I believe I fulfill the other criteria?\nIf you are currently in the United States in nonimmigrant status, you can apply, but you would have to depart the United States to be paroled back in if authorized. If you are not presently maintaining nonimmigrant status you may also apply, but you would have to depart the United States to be paroled back in if authorized. However, a failure to maintain your nonimmigrant status may result in immigration consequences including but not limited to removal, inadmissibility, and being barred from adjustment of status in some categories.\n\n\nHow to Apply as an Entrepreneur\nFiling Form I-941, Application for Entrepreneur Parole\n1. You must file Form I-941, Application for Entrepreneur Parole, with the required fee and supporting documents according to the Form I-941 instructions.\n2. Filing and obtaining approval of a Form I-941 under this rule will not, by itself, constitute a grant of parole. If your Form I-941 is conditionally approved and you are outside the United States, you must visit a U.S. embassy or consulate abroad to complete parole processing and obtain travel documentation (for example, a boarding foil) before appearing at a U.S. port of entry for a final parole determination. If your Form I-941 is approved and you are within the United States, you will be mailed travel documentation to the U.S. address listed on your Form I-941, unless you requested to receive the travel documentation through a U.S. embassy or consulate abroad. You would have to depart the United States before appearing at a U.S. port of entry using your travel documentation for a final parole determination. A Canadian national traveling directly from Canada to a U.S. port of entry may present an approved or conditionally approved Form I-941 at the U.S. port of entry without first obtaining travel documentation.\n3. You (as the Form I-941 applicant) do not need to file a Form I-765 to obtain employment authorization. If your Form I-941 is approved and you are paroled into the United States under the International Entrepreneur Rule after appearing at a U.S. port of entry, you are employment authorized for your startup entity incident to the grant of parole.\n4. You (as the Form I-941 applicant) do not need to file a Form I-131 to obtain travel documentation. If your Form I-941 is approved, USCIS will provide you with further instructions for obtaining and using your travel documentation dependent on whether you selected to receive your travel documentation at your U.S. mailing address or at a U.S. embassy or consulate abroad.\n\nIMPORTANT: If you are requesting to receive your travel document at your U.S. mailing address, please note that the I-512L Advance Parole document is a secure document that will only be sent to you at the U.S. mailing address you provided in your Form I-941 application. If you are represented by an attorney, an extra copy will not be sent to your attorney. Please ensure that your U.S. mailing address is correct, including any apartment, floor, or suite number if applicable, as well as providing any “In Care of Name” information, if any.\nIf you are requesting to receive your travel documentation through a U.S. embassy or consulate, please ensure your phone number and e-mail address are included and accurate as the U.S. embassy or consulate may try to contact you to schedule an appointment.\n\nFile your completed form(s) at the USCIS Dallas Lockbox facility.\nFor U.S. Postal Service (USPS): \nUSCIS\nAttn: IER\nPO Box 650890\nDallas, TX 75265\n\nFor FedEx, UPS, and DHL deliveries:\nUSCIS\nAttn: IER (Box 650890)\n2501 S.

If you request to receive your parole documentation at your U.S. mailing address listed on your application, we will send you a Biometrics Appointment Notice for an Application Support Center based on your U.S. mailing address. We will mail this notice to your U.S. mailing address.\n    a. If you request to receive your parole documentation at a U.S. embassy or consulate abroad, we will give you further instructions on how to appear for biometrics collection and identity verification at the U.S. embassy or consulate you listed on your application.\n    b. If you do not appear for your first biometrics appointment, we will send a second Biometrics Appointment Notice to your U.S. mailing address.\n2. If you do not appear for your biometrics appointment after we have issued you 2 separate Biometrics Appointment Notices, we may issue you an Abandonment Denial.\n\n\nQ. How do you collect my biometrics if I am an I-941 applicant inside the United States?\nA. If you selected on your Form I-941 to receive your parole documentation at your U.S. mailing address, we will schedule a biometrics appointment based on your U.S. mailing address. You will receive a Biometrics Appointment Notice at your U.S. mailing address outlining the process to appear for a biometrics appointment at a USCIS application support center. If your U.S. mailing address changes (https://www.uscis.gov/addresschange), please ensure that you notify USCIS.\n\nQ. If I am an applicant outside the United States, how do you collect my biometrics?\nA. If you have selected on your Form I-941 to receive your travel documentation at a U.S. embassy or consulate, we may make an initial decision on your application before collecting biometrics. If we determine that you meet the threshold criteria for parole under the International Entrepreneur Rule and that you merit favorable discretion to receive parole, we will issue you a Conditional Approval Notice with instructions for further parole processing, including biometrics collection and identity verification, at the U.S. embassy or consulate you listed on your Form I-941. We will also contact the U.S. embassy or consulate to request that they schedule you for an appointment with the Department of State consular section.\n\nQ.

Will I have to return to the United States for my biometrics appointment, and what will happen if I cannot return to the United States?\nA. The location of biometrics collection depends on your response in your Form I-941 about where you choose to receive your parole document. If you have chosen to receive your parole document at your U.S. mailing address but are no longer in the United States and cannot return, you should contact the USCIS Immigrant Investor Program Office immediately to notify us of your change of address and request for overseas processing at a U.S. embassy or consulate. Please be sure to include your application receipt number in your communication.\n\n\n\nForm I-9 Information\nGiven that DHS does not anticipate that sole proprietors will be eligible to participate in this program, a noncitizen entrepreneur granted parole will typically be an employee of the startup entity. Employees will need to complete Form I-9, Employment Eligibility Verification.\nThe following documents establish identity and employment authorization for employment with a specific employer for Form I-9 purposes under List A for an employee who is an entrepreneur granted parole:\n1. Foreign passport; and\n2. Form I-94, Arrival/Departure Record, indicating entrepreneur parole (PE-1) as the class of admission. The Form I-94 must include the following:\n    a. The same name that appears on the passport; and\n    b. An endorsement of the individual’s parole, if that period of endorsement has not yet expired and the proposed employment is not in conflict with any restrictions or limitations identified on the form.\n\nFor information on Form I-9 requirements, see I-9 Central (https://www.uscis.gov/i-9-central).\nThe spouse of a noncitizen entrepreneur granted parole may also be eligible for parole and apply for employment authorization once the spouse is paroled into the United States (see more details above). The spouse is only authorized to work if DHS has issued them a Form I-766, Employment Authorization Document. Children of entrepreneurs granted parole under this rule are not eligible for employment based on this parole.\n\nThreshold Criteria for the Entrepreneur (FAQs)\n\nQ. How much of my startup must I own as an entrepreneur for it to be “substantial ownership?” Is there a minimum, such as 10%?\nA. We are guided by DHS regulations at 8 CFR section 212.19 (https://www.ecfr.gov/current/title-8/chapter-I/subchapter-B/part-212/section-212.19). We consider ownership interest “substantial” if you (the Form I-941 applicant) have at least a 10% ownership interest in the startup entity at the time of adjudication of the initial grant of parole, and if you have at least a 5% ownership interest in the startup entity at the time of adjudication of a subsequent period of re-parole.\n\nQ.

What types of evidence can I provide to meet the regulatory requirement of having a central and active role in the operations of the startup entity?\nA.

See below under Filing Tips and Evidence Checklist (https://www.uscis.gov/working-in-the-united-states/international-entrepreneur-rule) for more detailed information.\n\n\n\nThreshold Criteria for the Startup Entity (FAQs)\n\nQ. What factors indicate “substantial potential for rapid growth and job creation”?\nA. You can show substantial potential for rapid growth and job creation by the receipt of significant capital investment from U.S. investors with established records of successful investments in startup entities.\nYou can also show this through significant awards or grants from certain federal, state, or local government entities that regularly provide awards or grants to startup entities.\nDHS regulations also include alternative criteria for applicants who partially meet the thresholds for capital investment or government awards or grants and can provide additional reliable and compelling evidence of their entities' significant potential for rapid growth and job creation.\n\nQ. Can investments or grants be to a parent, subsidiary, affiliated or related company?\nA. No. The investment or grants must be made to the qualifying startup entity itself.\n\nQ. What is the minimum amount that USCIS considers a significant investment of capital?\nA. The startup entity must have received a qualified investment (at least $311,071 as of Oct. 1, 2024) from one or more qualified investors  within 18 months immediately preceding the filing of your Form I-941.\nA qualified investment means a purchase from a startup entity of its equity, convertible debt, or other security convertible into its equity, commonly used in financing transactions within the startup entity's industry.\nA bank loan or personal loan that is not convertible into equity would typically not meet the regulatory definition of “qualified investment.”\n\nQ. What types of evidence can an entrepreneur submit to demonstrate that an investor in their startup entity meets the definition of a “qualified investor”?\nA. The regulation defines the term “qualified investor” to include an organization located in the United States and that operates through a legal entity organized under the laws of the United States or any state that is majority owned and controlled, directly and indirectly, by U.S. citizens or lawful permanent residents.\nAlthough we do not require the applicant to establish that at least 50% of the capital contributed to the fund is sourced from U.S. citizens or lawful permanent residents, the applicant must nevertheless show that the firm is majority owned and controlled, directly and indirectly, by U.S. citizens or lawful permanent residents. For example, we recognize that many investment firms based in the United States, such as venture capital firms, have a wide range of funding from limited partners that vest control in U.S. citizen partners who manage and even “control” the fund.\nThe applicant must also establish, among other things, that the investor has a successful history of accomplishment making investments in startup entities, and that the investment is a good faith investment of lawfully derived capital.\n\nQ. What is the minimum threshold for an established record of successful investments?\nA. The definition of a “qualified investor” requires the investor to have a history of substantial investment in successful startup entities. For this requirement, we consider such an individual or organization a qualified investor if, during the preceding 5 years, the following apply:\n1. The individual or organization made sufficient total investments in startup entities ($746,571 as of Oct. 1, 2024) in exchange for equity, convertible debt, or other security convertible into equity commonly used in financing transactions within the startup entities’ respective industries; and\n2. After such investment by such individual or organization, at least 2 such startup entities each created at least 5 qualified jobs or generated at sufficient revenue ($528,293, as of Oct. 1, 2024) with average annualized revenue growth of at least 20%.\nA “qualified job” means full-time employment located in the United States that has been filled for at least 1 year by one or more U.S. citizens, lawful permanent residents, or other noncitizens lawfully authorized to be employed in the United States, who is not an entrepreneur of the relevant startup entity (or the parent, spouse, brother, sister, son, or daughter of such entrepreneur) nor an independent contractor.\n\n\nQ. What is the minimum threshold for government grants or awards?\nA. You can show “substantial potential for rapid growth and job creation” if the startup entity has received at least  $124,429 (for applications filed on or after Oct. 1, 2024) through one or more qualified government awards or grants within 18 months immediately preceding the filing of Form I-941.\n\nQ. What types of government awards or grants would meet this requirement?\nA. A “qualified government award or grant” means an award or grant for economic development, research and development, or job creation (or other similar monetary award typically given to startup entities) made by a federal, state, or local government entity (not including foreign government entities) that regularly provides such awards or",

    "content": ") through one or more qualified government awards or grants within 18 months immediately preceding the filing of Form I-941.\n\nQ. What types of government awards or grants would meet this requirement?\nA. A “qualified government award or grant” means an award or grant for economic development, research and development, or job creation (or other similar monetary award typically given to startup entities) made by a federal, state, or local government entity (not including foreign government entities) that regularly provides such awards or grants to startup entities. This definition excludes any contractual commitment for goods or services.\nSome examples of qualified government awards and grants may include:\n1. Small Business Innovation Research and Small Business Technology Transfer awards (see SBIR.gov)\n2. Research and development (R&D) awards under the CHIPS for America program\n3. R&D awards from the U.S. Department of Energy, the National Science Foundation, and other federal government agencies\n4. Certain R&D or commercialization awards from state or local government economic development agencies, such as the Ohio Technology Validation and Startup Fund.\n\nQ. Does the government award or grant for the startup entity need to be initiated by the parole applicant or just by the entity that parole applicant is applying to work for?\nA. The government award or grant may be initiated by either the parole applicant or the startup entity. However, the grant must be awarded to the startup entity.\n\nQ. Can government awards or grants be from nations outside of the United States?\nA. No. Awards or grants from foreign government entities are not considered qualified government awards or grants under the International Entrepreneur Rule.\n\nQ. Why are the monetary thresholds for investment, revenue, and government awards and grants so specific?\nA. Every 3 years, by regulation, the threshold monetary amounts must increase according to the Consumer Price Index for All Urban Consumers. We will publish the new amounts on our website, and a technical update to the regulation itself will appear in the Federal Register. We expect that the next automatic update will go into effect at the beginning of Fiscal Year 2025 (Oct. 1, 2024).\n\n\nAlternative Criteria\n\nQ. What if my startup entity does not reach the monetary thresholds for “qualified investment” or “qualified government award or grant” described above?\nA. If the startup-entity has raised less than the threshold “qualified investment” and/or “qualified government awards or grants,” the applicant may still be able to demonstrate “substantial potential for rapid growth and job creation” through alternative reliable and compelling evidence.\nThe International Entrepreneur Rule recognizes that reliable and compelling evidence of the startup entity’s “substantial potential for rapid growth and job creation” may vary depending on the nature of the business and the industry it operates in. Therefore, applicants providing other reliable and compelling evidence of the startup entity’s potential are not limited to certain types of evidence.\nThis additional supporting evidence may include, but is not limited to:\n1. Evidence of rapid growth, such as:\n    a. Number of users or customers;\n    b. Revenue generated by the startup entity; and\n    c. Additional investments/fundraising, including crowdfunding platforms;\n2. Social impact of the startup entity;\n3. National scope of the startup entity;\n4. Positive effects on the startup entity’s locality or region;\n5. Success using alternative funding platforms, including crowdfunding platforms;\n6. The applicant’s academic degrees;\n7. The applicant’s prior success in operating startup entities as shown by patented innovations, annual revenue, job creation, or other factors;\n8. Selection of the startup entity to participate in one or more established reputable startup accelerators or incubators; and\n9. Any other reliable and compelling evidence that the startup entity has substantial potential for rapid growth and job creation.\n\n\nQ. What if an investor in my startup entity meets some, but not all, of the criteria for a “qualified investor”?\nA. Only an investor that fully satisfies the definition of “qualified investor” can make a “qualified investment” under the International Entrepreneur Rule. There is no alternative evidence to establish that an individual or organization is a “qualified investor.”\n\nQ. What if my startup entity has multiple investors that add to up to more than the threshold amount in “qualified investment,” but not if USCIS determines that one of my investors is not a “qualified investor”?\nA. In your application, you can indicate that you want your startup entity to be considered based on raising more than the threshold amount or based on raising less than the threshold amount plus alternative evidence. To do so, you can check “Yes” for both Question 10 and Question 14 on Form I-941, along with providing alternative evidence.\n\n\n\nFiling Tips and Evidence (FAQs)\nThe following checklist of required initial evidence is for informational purposes only. Please do not submit this checklist with your Form I-941. The checklist is an optional tool to use as you prepare your form, but does not replace statutory, regulatory, and form instruction requirements. We recommend that you review these requirements before completing and submitting your form. Do not send original documents unless specifically requested in the form instructions or applicable regulations.\nIf you submit any documents (copies or original documents, if requested) in a foreign language, you must include a full English translation along with a certification from the translator verifying that the translation is complete and accurate, and that they are competent to translate from the foreign language into English.\nUSCIS will evaluate all the evidence submitted, and will assess its credibility, relevance, and probative value, before determining whether the threshold criteria have been met and whether the applicant merits a favorable exercise of discretion. In addition to the examples of evidence listed below, an applicant is permitted (but not required) to submit alternative evidence that the applicant believes is credible, relevant, and probative.

See the section on Alternative Criteria (https://www.uscis.gov/working-in-the-united-states/international-entrepreneur-rule?acc=1&sec=9&ref=alt-criteria) above.\n\n\n\nIf I have evidence that I meet all the eligibility requirements for an entrepreneur and a startup entity described above, should I submit any additional supporting evidence?\nA. When considering an application under the International Entrepreneur Rule, the USCIS officer must decide whether granting parole would provide a “significant public benefit” to the United States. This is a case-by-case discretionary determination, considering the totality of the circumstances of each case.\nYou must demonstrate through evidence that both you and your startup entity meet the rule’s threshold criteria. You may also provide additional supporting evidence that an approval of your application would provide a “significant public benefit” to the United States, based on your role as an entrepreneur with the startup entity.\nSuch supporting evidence may include:\n1. Evidence of investments from any investors (not only “qualified investors”), or government awards or grants (not only “qualified government awards or grants”). Such evidence could include bank records, wire transfers, equity purchase agreements, equity certificates, equity ledgers, or capitalization tables.\n2. Evidence of revenue generation.\n3. Letters from relevant government agencies, qualified investors, or established business associations with knowledge of your entity’s research, products, or services, and confirming that your knowledge, skills, or experience would advance your entity’s business.\n4. News articles or other similar evidence that you or your startup entity have received significant attention or recognition.\n5. Evidence that you or your startup entity have been recently invited to participate in, are participating in, or have graduated from one or more established and reputable startup accelerators.\n6. Patent awards or other documents indicating that you or your startup entity are focused on developing new technologies or innovative research.\n7. Evidence that the startup-entity is furthering a critical and emerging technology or other science, technology, engineering, and math (STEM) area important to U.S. competitiveness. To identify a critical and emerging technology field, USCIS will consider governmental, academic, and other authoritative and instructive sources, and all other evidence submitted by the applicant. One such governmental source is the Critical and Emerging Technologies List Update (PDF) (https://www.whitehouse.gov/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Critical-and-Emerging-Technologies-List-2024-Update.pdf) published by the National Science and Technology Council.\n8. Evidence that you have played an active and central role in the success of prior startups, such as letters from relevant government agencies, qualified investors, or established business associations with knowledge of your prior startup activities.\n9. Academic degrees or other documentation indicating that you have knowledge, skills, or experience that would significantly advance your entity’s business.\n10. Tax or payroll records, Form I-9 records, or other documents indicating that your entity has created “qualified jobs” before you filed Form I-941.\n11. Any other reliable evidence indicating your startup entity’s potential for growth and your ability to advance your startup entity’s business in the United States.\n\n\n\nWhat Happens After Approval (FAQs)\n\nQ. If my Form I-941 is approved and I am already in the United States, how do I receive my parole documentation? What is the process if I am outside the United States?\nA. If USCIS finds that you meet the criteria for consideration and appear to merit a favorable exercise of discretion, then your Form I-941 will be conditionally approved and the following processes will then apply:\n1. If you are in the United States, you selected on your Form I-941 to receive your parole documentation at your U.S. mailing address, and we approve your Form I-941, we will also send you a multi-use Form I-512L Advance Parole document under separate cover that may arrive after your approval notice. After you receive your Form I-512L, you must depart the United States before appearing at a U.S. port of entry for a final parole determination by U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP).\n2. If you are outside the United States, or you have selected on your Form I-941 to receive your travel documentation at a U.S. embassy or consulate, and you are not a Canadian national traveling directly from Canada to a U.S. port of entry, we will conditionally approve your Form I-941 because you must visit a U.S. embassy or consulate to undergo biometrics collection and identity verification before you can obtain travel documentation (for example, a boarding foil). Instructions on contacting the U.S. embassy or consulate you selected on your Form I-941 will be in your Conditional Approval Notice. We will also contact the U.S. embassy or consulate to request that they schedule you for an appointment for biometrics collection and identity verification. After you receive your travel documentation, you can appear at a U.S. port of entry for a final parole determination by CBP. If you are paroled into the United States, you must contact USCIS as outlined in the instructions on your Conditional Approval Notice to receive a multi-use Form I-512L Advance Parole document, if you wish to travel outside the United States and seek parole back in during the period parole was authorized for.\n3.

If you are a Canadian national traveling directly from Canada to a U.S. port of entry, you may present an approved or conditionally approved Form I-941 at the U.S. port of entry without first obtaining travel documentation.\n\nIf circumstances do not meaningfully change after USCIS approves (or conditionally approves) your Form I-941, and DHS does not discover material information that was previously unavailable, CBP is likely to grant you parole at the port of entry.\n\n\nQ. Does the Department of State (including U.S. embassies and consulates), as distinct from DHS, have different requirements for the International Entrepreneur Rule?\nA. DHS is guided by the requirements of the International Entrepreneur Rule. The Department of State does not make parole determinations under this rule. USCIS first determines whether to authorize parole, and if authorized, U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) makes a final parole determination at the port of entry (both USCIS and CBP are components of DHS).\nIf you are outside the United States and need to appear at a U.S. embassy or consulate to complete parole processing, the Department of State conducts additional vetting and, if no new derogatory information or identities are discovered as a result of this process, issues travel documentation on behalf of USCIS. If new information is found by the Department of State through the vetting process, the U.S. embassy or consulate will notify USCIS, which will determine if the new information affects the parole authorization.\nOnce travel documentation is issued, parole is authorized. However, advance authorization of parole by USCIS does not guarantee that you will be paroled by CBP upon your appearance at a port of entry. CBP will make a separate, discretionary determination whether to grant parole at the port of entry. If circumstances do not meaningfully change and DHS does not discover material information that was previously unavailable during the inspection process, however, CBP is likely to grant you parole at a port of entry.\n\nQ. If I am an applicant who has been inspected and admitted to the United States on the Visa Waiver Program, can I remain in the United States past my I-94 expiration date until my request for parole is either conditionally approved or denied?\nA. A pending or conditionally approved Form I-941 application does not authorize you, if you are present in the United States in nonimmigrant status, to remain in the United States beyond the expiration of your authorized period of stay. Remaining in the United States beyond your authorized period of stay may have immigration consequences.\n\nQ. Am I allowed multiple entries to the United States if I have parole under the International Entrepreneur Rule?\nA. Yes, you may be allowed multiple entries to the United States if you have parole under the International Entrepreneur Rule. The maximum initial parole period is 2.5 years, which begins at the time of initial parole by CBP at a U.S. port of entry. If you then depart the United States and are granted parole upon your return at the U.S. port of entry, you may receive parole for up to the remainder of the 2.5years (the initial parole period). Any time you spend outside the United States during your parole period counts toward the maximum initial period of parole.\nIf you are in the United States when we authorize parole, and you selected on your Form I-941 to receive your parole documentation at your U.S. mailing address, we will mail you a multi-entry travel document that allows you to seek parole multiple times at a port of entry during its validity period.\nIf you are applying from abroad and receive a boarding foil from a U.S. embassy or consulate to authorize your initial parole into the United States, we will give you further instructions on how to receive a multi-use Form I-512L, Advance Parole document, after you have notified USCIS that CBP has paroled you in the United States.\n\n\nQ. What is the longest time I may remain in the United States if I receive parole through the International Entrepreneur Rule?\nA. You may be given an initial parole period of up to 2.5years. If approved for re-parole, you may receive up to another 2.5years, for a maximum of 5 years.\n\nQ. Can I change from International Entrepreneur Rule parolee to an immigrant or nonimmigrant status without leaving the United States?\nA. While in the United States in a period of parole, you may apply for classification as an immigrant or nonimmigrant, if you are eligible. However, because parole is not admission, you may be ineligible for adjustment of status or for a change of status to another nonimmigrant classification while in the United States. As a result, if your nonimmigrant or immigrant petition is approved, you may have to depart the United States to apply for a visa based on the petition approval (unless visa exempt) before traveling to a port of entry to request admission into the United States as an immigrant or nonimmigrant, as applicable.\nFor more information on immigrant and nonimmigrant options that may be available, see Options for Noncitizen Entrepreneurs to Work in the United States (https://www.uscis.gov/working-in-the-united-states/options-for-noncitizen-entrepreneurs-to-work-in-the-united-states).\n\n\nSpouses and Children (FAQs)\n\nQ.

How do my spouse and children obtain parole under the International Entrepreneur Rule?\nA. Your dependents may file Form I-131 at the same time you file Form I-941, regardless of whether they are inside or outside of the United States at the time of filing. Alternatively, your dependents may file Form I-131 after you file your Form I-941. For any I-131 or I-941 applicants outside the United States, we will send you a notice explaining where to submit biometrics in coordination with the Department of State or the international USCIS field office closest to you.\nIf you or your dependents are present in the United States and have requested to receive your parole document at the U.S. mailing address you indicated on Form I-941 (Part 1, Item 18) or Form I-131 (Part 3, Item 5), you will receive a notice to appear for biometrics collection at a USCIS Application Support Center based on the mailing address you listed on Form I-941 (Part 1, Item 19) or on Form I-131 (Part 1, Item 2). If you are in the United States, you must appear for your biometrics collection at an Application Support Center for your Form I-941 to be considered for approval, unless you requested to receive your parole document at the U.S. embassy or consulate.\nIf you or your dependents are currently outside of the United States and have requested to receive your parole document at the U.S. embassy or consulate you indicated on Form I-941 (Part 1, Item 18) or Form I-131 (Part 3, Item 6), you will receive a notification from USCIS about processing at the U.S. embassy or consulate if we have conditionally approved your application.\nYou and your dependents do not have to be in the same location to apply for parole under the International Entrepreneur Rule. However, if the physical locations are different, the processing of the applications may differ based on location as previously described.\n\nQ. When will my spouse be authorized to work?\nA. Spouses who are paroled into the United States by U.S. Customs and Border Protection may immediately apply for employment authorization by filing Form I-765, Application for Employment Authorization (https://www.uscis.gov/i-765). A spouse may submit the application only after they are paroled into the United States. The spouse will not be authorized to work in the United States until the Form I-765 is approved and an Employment Authorization Document is issued.\n\n\n\nRe-parole (FAQs)\n\nQ. After the first parole period of up to 2.5 years, how do I extend my period of stay?\nA. You can apply for one additional period of re-parole for up to 2.5 years. Before the expiration of the initial period of parole, you must timely file another Form I-941, along with another Form I-131 for any spouse or children whose parole period would otherwise expire.\n\nQ. What are the eligibility requirements for re-parole?\nA. You are no longer required to demonstrate an ownership interest of 10 percent when applying for re-parole. Instead, as of the date USCIS adjudicates the application for re-parole, you must have retained at least a 5 percent ownership in the startup entity.\nIn general, you must demonstrate that this second grant of parole would continue to provide a significant public benefit, by establishing that during the initial parole period the startup entity has:\n1. Received a qualified investment, qualified government grants or awards, or a combination of such funding, of at least $622,142 (for applications filed on or after Oct. 1, 2024);\n2. Created at least 5 qualified jobs with the startup entity; or\n3. Reached annual revenue in the United States of at least $622,142 (for applications filed on or after Oct. 1, 2024), and averaged at least 20 percent in annual revenue growth.\n\nIf the startup entity partially meets one or more of the general criteria above, you may provide alternative reliable and compelling evidence of the startup entity’s substantial potential for rapid growth and job creation.\n\n\nQ. What are my options after the 5 years of parole and re-parole?\nA. Although the International Entrepreneur Rule provides for a maximum of 5 years, the intent is for this to provide enough time for the entrepreneur to transition to a more durable status as they become eligible. For more information about both nonimmigrant and immigrant pathways, see our resources on Options for Noncitizen Entrepreneurs to Work in the United States (https://www.uscis.gov/working-in-the-united-states/options-for-noncitizen-entrepreneurs-to-work-in-the-united-states).\n\n\n\nProcessing Times (FAQs)\n\nQ. How long does it take to process an International Entrepreneur Rule application?\nA. As of May 2024, we have either completed or sent a Request for Evidence for all previously filed Form I-941 applications and associated Form I-131 applications. We look forward to adjudicating new applications as expeditiously as possible.\n\nQ. What if I need faster processing?\nA. At present, Form I-941 is not eligible for premium processing (https://www.uscis.gov/forms/all-forms/how-do-i-request-premium-processing), because under current regulations we may only provide this service for Form I-129, Form I-140, Form I-765, and Form I",

The decision to expedite is within the sole discretion of USCIS. Expediting your case generally means that we would adjudicate your application ahead of other applications, including those who may have filed earlier, so we carefully weigh the urgency and merit of each expedite request.\n\n\nQ. Given wait times at most U.S. embassies and consulates around the world, are USCIS and the Department of State taking any steps to ensure timely processing?\nA. We are coordinating closely with the Department of State to ensure timely and efficient processing of International Entrepreneur Rule applicants who have opted for processing abroad and have received a Conditional Approval. Processing at a U.S. embassy or consulate may occur within weeks after we issue a Conditional Approval. Biometrics submission and boarding foil processing also depend on the availability of the applicant to appear at the U.S. embassy or consulate for biometrics collection and identity verification.\nTo avoid processing delays, please make sure that your contact information, including your mailing address, e-mail address, and phone number, are correct on your Form I-941 or Form I-131 and that you provide timely updates to USCIS of any changes in your mailing address by following these instructions (https://www.uscis.gov/addresschange). A U.S. embassy or consulate may try to contact you by phone or e-mail. If you are an entrepreneur, you may provide your phone number and e-mail address on Form I-941. If you are a spouse or child of an entrepreneur, you may provide your phone number on Form I-131 in the designated section in “Part 3, Processing Information” and your e-mail address in Part 3 in the blank space underneath the “Phone Number.”\nAdditionally, please make sure that you select the correct location where you will receive your travel documents, as your response to this question will also determine where the U.S. government will collect your biometrics. If you are an entrepreneur, you may select your processing location on Form I-941 (Part 1, Item 18). If you are the spouse or child of an entrepreneur, you may select your processing location on Form I-131 (Part 3, Item 6).\n\n\nQ. How is processing affected if I have chosen to receive my parole document at my U.S. mailing address?\nA. If you are in the United States and have opted in Form I-941 to receive your parole document at a U.S. mailing address (Part 1, Item 18), you will receive a notice to appear for a biometrics appointment at an Application Support Center based on your U.S. mailing address (Part 1, Item 19). You must appear for your biometrics appointment for us to consider your Form I-941 application for approval. To avoid delays, please ensure you notify us of any address change within the U.S. by following these instructions (https://www.uscis.gov/addresschange). If applicable, please ensure that you include the apartment, floor, or suite number of your U.S. mailing address. Please also provide any “In Care Of Name” information, if any.\nIMPORTANT: If you opted to receive your parole document at your U.S. mailing address, please note that the I-512L Advance Parole document is a secure document that will only be sent to you at the U.S. mailing address you provided in your Form I-941 application. If you are represented by an attorney, an extra copy will not be sent to your attorney. If your designated mailing address is your attorney’s address, please ensure you write “In Care of Name” on your application.\n\n\n\nWe recommend that you review this FAQ page, as well as the comprehensive guidance on the International Entrepreneur Rule (https://www.uscis.gov/policy-manual/volume-3-part-g) in our Policy Manual and our Form I-941 (https://www.uscis.gov/i-941) page before you e-mail a question.\nYou may email the USCIS Immigrant Investor Program Office to:\n1. Change the contact or attorney information on an IER application;\n2. Change the address where USCIS sends the travel documents abroad;\n3. Report problems with IER biometrics processing;\n4.

For more information about the employment authorization verification process, see our I-9 Central (https://www.uscis.gov/i-9-central) page.\n\nAs an employer, you may require the services of a noncitizen to work at your company or business. If the individual is already a permanent resident (Green Card holder), you may hire that individual, but you must comply with the employment verification requirements.\n\nIf the noncitizen is not already a permanent resident, you will need to file a petition so that the individual may obtain the appropriate immigrant or nonimmigrant classification.  You may choose to file an immigrant petition (permanent) (https://www.uscis.gov/working-in-the-united-states/permanent-workers) or a nonimmigrant petition (temporary) (https://www.uscis.gov/working-in-the-united-states/temporary-nonimmigrant-workers) on behalf of that employee.\n\n\nEmployees\nNo noncitizen may accept employment in the United States unless they have been authorized to do so. Some noncitizen, such as those who have been admitted as permanent residents, granted asylum or refugee status, or admitted in work-related nonimmigrant classifications, may have employment authorization as a direct result of their immigration status. Other noncitizens may need to apply individually for employment authorization.\nThere are many ways in which a person may be able to work in the United States. You may seek an immigration classification that permits you to live and work in the United States permanently or temporarily. In most instances, your employer or potential employer must petition for you. In this Working in the United States section (https://www.uscis.gov/working-in-the-united-states), you will find information about coming to the United States to work temporarily or permanently and the many different eligibility categories for working in the United States.\n\nUS Federal Tax Information\nEmployers who employ foreign workers may be subject to special U.S. tax withholding rules. \nForeign nationals employed in the U.S. may have a U.S. tax obligation.

Unretouched means the photos must not be edited or digitally enhanced. The submission of any mounted or retouched images will delay the processing of your application and may prompt USCIS to require you to visit an Application Support Center to verify your identity.\n\nOptional practical training (OPT) is temporary employment that is directly related to an F-1 student’s major area of study. Eligible students can apply to receive up to 12 months of OPT employment authorization before completing their academic studies (pre-completion) and/or after completing their academic studies (post-completion). However, all periods of pre-completion OPT will be deducted from the available period of post-completion OPT.\n\nTypes of OPT\nAll OPT must be directly related to your major area of study. If you are an F-1 student, you may be eligible to participate in OPT in two different ways:\n\nPre-completion OPT: You may apply to participate in pre-completion OPT after you have been lawfully enrolled on a full-time basis for one full academic year at a college, university, conservatory, or seminary that has been certified by the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) Student and Exchange Visitor Program (SEVP) to enroll F-1 students. You do not need to have had F-1 status for the one full academic year; you can satisfy the “one full academic year” requirement even if you had another nonimmigrant status during that time.\nIf you are authorized to participate in pre-completion OPT, you may work (20 hours or less per week) while school is in session. You may work full time when school is not in session.\n\nPost-completion OPT: You may apply to participate in post-completion OPT after completing your studies. If you are authorized for post-completion OPT, you must work part time (at least 20 hours per week) or full time.\nImpact of Pre-completion OPT Employment Authorization on Requests for Post-completion OPT at the Same Education Level\n\nIf you have already received 1 year of part-time (20 hours per week) pre-completion OPT, the total time of full-time OPT still available would be reduced by 6 months, 50% of the previously authorized year at the same education level. In this scenario, you would only be entitled to a remaining period of 6 months full-time post-completion OPT employment authorization.\n\nIf you have already received 1 year of full-time (40 hours per week) pre-completion OPT, the total time of full-time optional practical training still available would be reduced by 1 year, 100% of the previously authorized year at the same education level. In this scenario, you would not be entitled to any period of post-completion OPT employment authorization.\n\nSTEM OPT Extension\nIf you have earned a degree in certain Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics (STEM) fields, you may apply for a 24-month extension of your post-completion OPT employment authorization if you:\n\nAre an F-1 student who received a STEM degree included on the STEM Designated Degree Program List (PDF https://www.ice.gov/sites/default/files/documents/Document/2016/stem-list.pdf);\nAre employed by an employer who is enrolled in and is using E-Verify; and\nReceived an initial grant of post-completion OPT employment authorization based on your STEM degree.\nIf you are interested in applying for a STEM OPT extension, please see our Optional Practical Training Extension for STEM Students (STEM OPT) page (https://www.uscis.gov/working-in-the-united-states/students-and-exchange-visitors/optional-practical-training-extension-for-stem-students-stem-opt) for more information.\n\nApplying for OPT\nGenerally, you must:\nRequest that your designated school official (DSO) at your academic institution recommend the OPT. Your DSO will make the recommendation by endorsing your Form I‑20, Certification of Eligibility for Nonimmigrant Student Status, and making the appropriate notation in the Student and Exchange Visitor Information System (SEVIS) (https://www.ice.gov/sevis/overview).\nProperly file Form I-765,Application for Employment Authorization with USCIS (https://www.uscis.gov/i-765), accompanied by the required fee and the supporting documentation as described in the form instructions.\n\n\nWhen to apply?\n\nSTEM degree\tPre-completion OPT\t\nMust apply after your DSO enters the recommendation for OPT into your SEVIS record, and\nMay apply up to 90 days before you complete a full academic year, as long as you do not start OPT employment until you complete one full academic year.\n\nInitial post-completion OPT\t\nMust apply after your DSO enters the recommendation for OPT into your SEVIS record, and\nMust apply within 30 days after your DSO enters the recommendation for OPT into your SEVIS record, and\nMay apply up to 90 days before you complete your degree, but no later than 60 days after you complete your degree.\n\nSTEM OPT extension\t\nMust apply after your DSO enters the recommendation for OPT into your SEVIS record, and\nMust apply within 60 days after your DSO enters the recommendation for OPT into your SEVIS record, and\nMay apply up to 90 days before your current OPT employment authorization expires.\n\nNon-STEM degree\tPre-completion OPT\t\nMust apply after your DSO enters the recommendation for OPT into your SEVIS record, and\nMay apply up to 90 days before you complete a full academic year, as long as you do not start OPT employment until",

This automatic 180-day extension ceases once USCIS adjudicates your STEM OPT extension application.\n\nTransferring to a Different School or Beginning Study at Another Educational Level\nIf you transfer to another school or begin studies at another educational level (for example, you completed a bachelor’s degree and are starting a master’s program), your authorization to engage in OPT employment will automatically terminate. SEVP will inform USCIS of the termination date, and USCIS will terminate your EAD accordingly.\n\nAlthough your authorization to engage in optional practical training will end, as long as you comply with all requirements for maintaining your student status, your F-1 status will not be affected by USCIS terminating your EAD. Maintaining your student status includes not working on a terminated EAD, as the termination means that you are no longer authorized to work in the United States using that OPT EAD. Working in the United States without authorization has serious consequences, including removal from the country and reentry bars. Also, remaining in the United States in violation of your lawful nonimmigrant status could lead to an accrual of unlawful presence. Please see USCIS Changing Policy on Accrued Unlawful Presence by Nonimmigrant Students and Exchange Visitors (https://www.uscis.gov/laws-and-policy/other-resources/unlawful-presence-and-inadmissibility) for more information regarding termination of your employment authorization under OPT and any impacts on your student status, including the possible accrual of unlawful presence.\nIf you feel that your EAD has been wrongfully terminated, would like to request reconsideration of the EAD termination, or if you have other questions, see your DSO.\n\nCap-gap Extension for F-1 Students with Approved H-1B Petitions\nIf you are an F-1 student with a timely filed H-1B petition and change of status request, and your F-1 status and employment authorization will expire before the change of status to H-1B occurs (typically Oct. 1), you may be eligible for a cap-gap extension.

They provide lawful permanent residence (Green Card) which can eventually lead to U.S. citizenship.\n\nThe lawful permanent resident process involves at least two steps, depending on the employment-based immigrant visa classification sought.  An immigrant petition must be filed with USCIS and then, if you are in the United States and eligible, you may file an adjustment of status application with USCIS without departing the United States, or you may file an immigrant visa application with the U.S. Department of State (DOS) outside the United States and go through consular processing.\n\nAn approved immigrant visa petition secures your priority date that will determine the order of immigrant visa availability. Your priority date is generally the date the immigrant visa petition was filed on your behalf. You may only file an adjustment of status application, or request a visa through a consulate, once an immigrant visa is immediately available. If an immigrant visa is immediately available when you or your sponsoring employer files the immigrant petition with USCIS, you may file your adjustment application at the same time. You are eligible to apply for employment authorization concurrently with your adjustment application and while your adjustment application is pending.\n\nThe availability of an immigrant visa will depend on the employment-based classification being sought and the immigrant’s country of chargeability (usually the country of birth).\n\nThe USCIS webpages on Visa Availability and Priority Dates (https://www.uscis.gov/green-card/green-card-processes-and-procedures/visa-availability-and-priority-dates) and Consular Processing (https://www.uscis.gov/green-card/green-card-processes-and-procedures/consular-processing) provide information about the DOS Visa Bulletin process and explain how DOS allocates immigrant visas and consular processing generally.\n\nEB-1A – Extraordinary Ability\nYou may be eligible for the EB-1A extraordinary ability immigrant classification if you have extraordinary ability in the sciences, arts, education, business, or athletics as demonstrated by sustained national or international acclaim and recognized achievements in the field of expertise. In addition, you must show that you will continue working in your area of extraordinary ability and that your work will substantially benefit the United States in the future. Extraordinary ability means that your level of expertise indicates that you are one of the small percentage of individuals who have risen to the very top of your field. You may self-petition as an extraordinary ability individual, because a job offer is not required for this classification.\n\nRequirement 1- You must be able to establish that you have extraordinary ability in your field.\nThe EB-1A extraordinary ability classification is for people who are recognized as being at the very top of their field and who are coming to (or remaining in) the United States to continue work in that field. To establish eligibility, you must demonstrate sustained national or international acclaim and that your achievements have been recognized in the field of expertise by showing that you:\n1. Have received a major internationally recognized award; or\n2. Meet at least 3 of the 10 requirements listed below and all your evidence, when evaluated together, shows that you are among the small percentage of individuals that have risen to the very top of your field.\nIf you have not received a major internationally recognized award, you must answer yes and submit evidence for at least 3 of the 10 questions below:\n1. Have you received any lesser nationally or internationally recognized prizes or awards for excellence in the field of endeavor?\n2. Are you, or have you been, a member of associations that require outstanding achievements of their members as judged by recognized national or international experts?\n3. Is there published material in professional or major trade publications or major media about you which relates to your work in the field?\n4. Have you participated on a panel or individually as a judge of the work of others in the same or in an allied field of specialization?\n5. Have you made original scientific, scholarly or business-related contributions that are of major significance?\n6. Have you authored scholarly articles in professional journals or other major media?\n7. Has your work been displayed at artistic exhibitions or showcases?\n8. Have you played a leading or critical role for an organization with a distinguished reputation?\n9. Have you commanded a high salary or other remuneration for your services in comparison to others in your field?\n10 Have you enjoyed commercial successes in the performing arts?\n\nNote: If the criteria discussed in this section do not readily apply to your occupation, you may submit comparable evidence to establish your eligibility. However, there is no comparable evidence for the one-time achievement of a major, internationally recognized award.\nIf you meet these minimum threshold requirements, USCIS will then evaluate all the evidence you submitted  to determine whether you have sustained national or international acclaim and recognized achievements in your field of expertise and that you are one of the small percentage of individuals who have risen to the very top of your field.\nThe USCIS Policy Manual includes (https://www.uscis.gov/policy-manual/volume-6-part-f-chapter-2) detailed guidance regarding how EB-1A eligibility is evaluated, including a discussion of considerations that are relevant to evaluating evidence under each of the above criteria and evaluating comparable evidence.\n\nRequirement 2 – You must be able to establish that you are coming to (or remaining in) the United States to continue to work in your area of extraordinary ability and your entry will substantially benefit the United States.\nSome of the evidence you may submit to meet this requirement includes, but is not limited to:\n1.

Letters from current or prospective employers;\n2. Documents evidencing your prearranged commitments (such as contracts); and\n3. A statement detailing your plans on how you intend to continue working in your field in the United States.\n\nEB-2 Employment-Based Second Preference with National Interest Waiver (NIW) - Exceptional ability or advanced degree professional with NIW\nThe EB-2 immigrant visa category(https://www.uscis.gov/working-in-the-united-states/permanent-workers/employment-based-immigration-second-preference-eb-2) is for noncitizens who are either professionals with advanced degrees or individuals with exceptional ability in the sciences, arts, or business. This category generally requires a job offer and a labor certification issued by the U.S. Department of Labor (DOL) before an employer could move on to the next step of filing an immigrant visa petition with USCIS and (if approved) before a beneficiary could be issued an immigrant visa through adjustment or consular processing. Please visit DOL’s website to learn more about the labor certification process (https://www.dol.gov/agencies/eta/foreign-labor/programs/permanent).\n\nDOL regulations generally prohibit the issuance of labor certifications in self-employment scenarios. However, an entrepreneur seeking EB-2 classification and a National Interest Waiver (NIW) may self-petition and not be subject to the labor certification requirement. Accordingly, one option for entrepreneurs includes filing an EB-2 visa petition if they can qualify for an NIW, which exempts them from the job offer requirement and, thus, the labor certification requirement.\n\nIf you are requesting a NIW, you must first demonstrate that you are either a member of the professions holding an advanced degree or an individual of exceptional ability.\n\nAdvanced Degree Professionals\nRequirement 1 – You must show that you have a U.S. advanced degree or foreign equivalent degree.\nAn \"advanced degree” is an academic or professional degree above a bachelor’s degree. Some of the evidence you may submit to demonstrate that you have an advanced degree may include:\n1. Copies of official transcripts;\n2. Certified copies of the actual degree, diploma, certificate, or similar award;\n3. Any other official documentation from the school’s Office of the Registrar;\n4. An evaluation from an educational evaluation agency, if you obtained your degree outside the United States; and\n5. If you only have a U.S. bachelor’s degree (or foreign equivalent degree), letters from your current and/or prior employers showing at least 5 years of progressively responsible experience in your field after you received the degree.\n\nThe USCIS Policy Manual (https://www.uscis.gov/policy-manual) includes detailed guidance on how we determine eligibility for advanced degree professionals (https://www.uscis.gov/policy-manual/volume-6-part-f-chapter-5#S-A).\n\nRequirement 2 – Your advanced degree must be related to the field in which you will be working.\nSome of the evidence you may submit to demonstrate that your advanced degree relates to your field includes, but is not limited to:\n1. A letter from you or your prospective employer describing your current or proposed job;\n2. Documents describing your company and its work; and\n3. A copy of your company’s annual report, if one is issued.\n\nExceptional Ability\nRequirement 1 – You must show that you have exceptional ability in the sciences, arts, or business.\nTo qualify for the EB-2 exceptional ability classification, you must show that you have exceptional ability in the sciences, arts, or business. The initial evidence must include at least three of the six types of evidence listed below. If you meet the minimum threshold requirements, USCIS will then evaluate all the evidence you submitted in its totality to determine whether you have a degree of expertise significantly above that normally encountered in the sciences, arts, or business. You must answer yes and submit evidence for at least three of the six questions below:\n1. Have you received a degree, diploma, certificate or similar award from a college, university, school or other institution, relating to the field of exceptional ability?\n2. Do you have at least 10 years of full-time experience in your field?\n3. If required, do you have a license or certification to practice in your profession or occupation?\n4. Have you or will you command a high salary or other remuneration for your services, which demonstrates your exceptional ability?\n5. Are you a member of professional associations?\n6. Have you been recognized for achievements and significant contributions to your industry or field?\n\nNote: If any of the criteria discussed in this section do not readily apply to your occupation, you may submit comparable evidence to establish your eligibility.\nIf you meet these minimum threshold requirements, USCIS will then evaluate all the evidence you submitted in its totality to determine whether you have a degree of expertise significantly above that normally encountered in the sciences, arts, or business.\nThe USCIS Policy Manual  includes detailed guidance on how we determine eligibility for exceptional ability classification (https://www.uscis.gov/policy-manual/volume-6-part-f-chapter-5#S-B).\n\nRequirement 2 – You must show that you will substantially benefit prospectively the U.S. economy, U.S. cultural interests, U.S. educational interests, or U.S. welfare.\nA prospective benefit is generally shown by documenting a past record of achievements and explaining how that indicates your future success.\nSome of the evidence you may submit to demonstrate how you will substantially benefit the United States prospect",

Letters from experts in your field regarding your accomplishments and their significance, including how your work will prospectively benefit the United States; and\n6. Evidence of past achievements should be accompanied with documentation or explanations of how these accomplishments indicate future or continued success.\n\nNational Interest Waiver\nUSCIS may, as a matter of discretion, grant your request for a National Interest Waiver where the below requirements are met:\n1. Your proposed endeavor has both substantial merit and national importance.\n2. You are well-positioned to advance the proposed endeavor.\n3. On balance, it would be beneficial to the United States to waive the requirements of a job offer, and thus the labor certification.\n\nThe USCIS Policy Manual (https://www.uscis.gov/policy-manual) includes detailed guidance on how we evaluate eligibility for national interest waivers based on the above requirements (https://www.uscis.gov/policy-manual/volume-6-part-f-chapter-5#S-D), and it also includes a discussion of specific evidentiary considerations for entrepreneurs (https://www.uscis.gov/policy-manual/volume-6-part-f-chapter-5#S-D-4). For example, there may be unique aspects of evidence submitted by an entrepreneurial petitioner undertaking a proposed endeavor, including through an entity based in the United States in which the petitioner typically possesses (or will possess) an ownership interest, and in which the petitioner maintains (or will maintain) an active and central role such that the petitioner’s knowledge, skills, or experience would significantly advance the proposed endeavor.\nUSCIS considers that entrepreneurs do not follow traditional career paths and start-ups vary in structure. In addition to the general guidance, the USCIS Policy Manual (https://www.uscis.gov/policy-manual) clarifies that as an entrepreneur petitioner, you may submit other types of evidence to establish that your endeavor has substantial merit and national importance, that you are well positioned to advance the endeavor, and that, on balance, it would be beneficial to waive the job offer and thus labor certification requirements.\n\nEB-5 – Immigrant Investor Program\nCongress created the EB-5 program (https://www.uscis.gov/working-in-the-united-states/permanent-workers/eb-5-immigrant-investor-program) to stimulate the U.S. economy through job creation and capital investment by foreign investors. This section will focus on entrepreneurs investing in their own businesses. For information on investors pooling their investments through the Regional Center Program, see About the EB-5 Visa Classification (https://www.uscis.gov/working-in-the-united-states/permanent-workers/employment-based-immigration-fifth-preference-eb-5/about-the-eb-5-visa-classification). \n\nWhat investment is required?\nYou must invest in a new commercial enterprise established after Nov. 29, 1990. You must invest $1.05 million unless the enterprise is doing business in a targeted employment area, which is one that has a high unemployment rate or is in a rural area. In that case the minimum investment is $800,000. You must establish the lawful source of your invested capital.\n\nWhat job creation is required?\nYou must establish that the new commercial enterprise will create full-time positions for at least 10 qualifying employees.\n\nAre there any requirements after I become a permanent resident?\nImmigrant investors are admitted as lawful permanent residents on a conditional basis. Within ninety days before the two-year anniversary of obtaining conditional lawful permanent resident status, you must apply to remove the conditions on your status. For more information on removing conditions, see EB-5 Immigrant Investor Process (https://www.uscis.gov/working-in-the-united-states/permanent-workers/employment-based-immigration-fifth-preference-eb-5/eb-5-immigrant-investor-process).",

General\nPractical training (PT) is employment that is directly related to a student’s major area of study.[1]\n\nF-1 students may engage in three types of PT:\n\nCurricular Practical Training (CPT);\nOptional Practical Training (OPT) (pre-completion or post-completion); and\nScience, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics Optional Practical Training extension (STEM OPT).\nPT may be authorized for an F-1 student at a U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) Student and Exchange Visitor Program (SEVP)-certified college, university, conservatory, or seminary, who has been lawfully enrolled, full-time, for one full academic year. Students may count time enrolled in a study abroad program toward the full academic year requirement, if the student spent at least one full academic term (that is, one semester, trimester, or quarter) enrolled in a full course of study in the United States prior to studying abroad.[2]\n\nStudents in English language training programs are ineligible for PT.[3]\n\nM-1 students may engage in PT only after they complete their course of study.[4]\n\nB. F-1 Student Curricular Practical Training\nCPT is alternative work-study, cooperative education, or any other type of required internship or practicum that is offered by sponsoring employers through cooperative agreements with the school.[5] No application to USCIS for employment authorization or an Employment Authorization Document (EAD) (Form I-766) is required, but the student must request authorization for CPT from the student’s Designated School Official (DSO). The CPT must be an integral part of an established curriculum.[6]\n\nCPT occurs before the student’s program end date on the Certificate of Eligibility for Nonimmigrant Student Status (Form I-20). CPT may be part-time or full-time.[7] An F-1 student who has received 1 year or more of full-time CPT is ineligible for post-completion OPT at the same educational level.[8]\n\nTo participate in CPT, students must:\n\nHave completed one full academic year and be lawfully enrolled on a full-time basis at an approved ICE SEVP-certified school;[9]\nBe enrolled in a full course of study;\nObtain their DSO’s endorsement on their Form I-20 and not begin CPT before the CPT start date indicated on the form;[10]\nParticipate in an alternative work/study, internship, cooperative education or any other type of required internship or practicum that is offered by sponsoring employers through cooperative agreements with the students’ respective schools;[11] and\nNot be English language training students.\nC. F-1 Student Optional Practical Training\nOPT can be authorized either prior to completion of the degree program (pre-completion OPT) or following the completion of the degree program (post-completion OPT). Pre-completion OPT can be completed while school is in session, provided that the training does not exceed 20 hours a week while school is in session. During the student’s annual vacation and at other times when school is not in session, OPT can exceed 20 hours per week if the student is currently enrolled, is eligible for registration, and intends to register for the next term or session.[12]\n\nA student may be authorized for 12 months of OPT and would become eligible for another 12 months of practical training if the student were to change to a higher educational level.[13]\n\nA student who has not used any practical training and changes to a lower education level, where OPT would normally be available, may use the student’s initial 12 months of practical training at the lower education level. Each period of OPT must be recommended by the DSO and authorized by USCIS, as shown by a valid EAD.[14] If an F-1 student applies for post-completion OPT at the same educational level at which the student had pre-completion OPT, the amount of time approved for pre-completion OPT is deducted from the post-completion OPT authorized period.\n\nOvertime and periods of unemployment are not considered when calculating the amount of OPT used. Rather, OPT usage is calculated based on the period of OPT authorized. For example, if an F-1 student had already received 6 months of full-time pre-completion OPT during the same degree program, but with overtime the total number of hours worked was equivalent to 7 months, the total remaining OPT time still available would be reduced by 6 months, half of the previously authorized year.\n\nAn F-1 student who has completed an authorized period of post-completion OPT may remain in F-1 status for 60 days beyond the EAD expiration date.[15] This is commonly known as a grace period, during which the F-1 student may contact their DSO to change their education level, transfer to another SEVP-certified school,[16] or file an application or petition with USCIS to change to another nonimmigrant or immigrant status.\n\nOPT, including STEM OPT, is automatically terminated if an F-1 student:\n\nTransfers to another school;             \nBegins a new degree level at the same school;\nChanges to a different nonimmigrant status, such as H-1B;\nFails to maintain F-1 status; or\nIs enrolled in a school that closes.\nThe effective termination date is the release date in the Student and Exchange Visitor Information System (SEVIS) for school transfer or change of program at a new degree level; the effective date of the new nonimmigrant status; the date the student violated F-1 status, as appropriate; or the date that ICE SEVP terminates the school in SEVIS upon the school’s closure. \n\n1.

Pre-Completion OPT\nA student enrolled at an ICE SEVP-certified college, university, conservatory, or seminary may apply to USCIS for authorization for pre-completion OPT by properly filing an Application for Employment Authorization (Form I-765) after obtaining the DSO’s recommendation.\n\nThe student may not begin pre-completion OPT until the date indicated on the student’s EAD. A student may submit a Form I-765 to engage in pre-completion OPT up to 90 days prior to being enrolled for one full academic year, provided that the period of employment will not begin until after the completion of the full academic year as indicated by the DSO. Students need an EAD for each period of pre-completion OPT.\n\nEligibility\n\nStudents must:[17]\n\nObtain the DSO’s recommendation and have their DSO’s recommendation entered into the student’s SEVIS record and annotated on their Form I-20;\nBe enrolled, on a full-time basis, at an ICE SEVP-certified college, university, conservatory, or seminary;\nHave completed one full-time academic year or be within 90 days of completing one full academic year at the time of filing Form I-765;[18]\nProperly file a Form I-765 with USCIS and receive a valid EAD;\nNot be an English language training student; and\nMaintain a full course of study.\nTime Limitations on Pre-Completion OPT\n\nPre-completion OPT is incremental and cumulative, up to 12 months. It may be granted over the course of the degree program and must take place before the program end date. Any time used for pre-completion OPT impacts the amount of post-completion OPT that USCIS may authorize.\n\n2. Post-Completion OPT\nEligibility\n\nTo be eligible to apply to USCIS for post-completion OPT[19] a student must:\n\nHave completed a course of study or be in an associate’s, bachelor’s, master’s, or doctoral degree program and have completed all course requirements for the degree (excluding thesis or equivalent);\nNot be an English language training student;\nObtain the DSO’s recommendation and have the DSO’s recommendation entered into the student’s SEVIS record and annotated on their Form I-20;\nProperly file a Form I-765 and receive a valid EAD; and\nNot have completed 1 year or more of full-time CPT.\nA student may work as a volunteer or unpaid intern, as long as this practice does not violate any labor laws, and the employment is related to the program of study. The student must work at least 20 hours per week.[20]\n\nTime Limitations on Post-Completion OPT\n\nPost-completion OPT begins on the date USCIS adjudicates the employment authorization request or the date the DSO requests, whichever is later.[21] A student may not request a start date that is more than 60 days after the student’s program end date.[22] A student must complete all practical training within a 14-month period following the completion of study.[23]\n\nAn F-1 student may be authorized up to 12 months of practical training, and becomes eligible for another 12 months of practical training when they change to a higher educational level.[24] If an F-1 student applies for post-completion OPT at the same educational level in which the student had pre-completion OPT, the amount of time approved for pre-completion OPT is deducted from the post-completion OPT authorized period.\n\nOvertime and periods of unemployment are not taken into consideration when calculating the amount of OPT used. For example, if an F-1 student had already received 1 year of part-time pre-completion OPT during the same degree program, the total remaining OPT time still available would be reduced by 6 months, half of the previously authorized year.\n\nAn F-1 student who has completed an authorized period of post-completion OPT may remain in F-1 status for 60 days beyond the EAD expiration date. During this grace period, an F-1 student may prepare for departure from the United States.[25] The F-1 student and any dependents must depart the United States by the end of the grace period if they do not either change the student’s nonimmigrant status, or transfer to an ICE SEVP-certified school.[26]\n\nAn F-1 student may not accrue an aggregate of more than 90 days of unemployment during the period of post-completion OPT.\n\n3. STEM OPT Extension\nAn F-1 student who meets certain qualifications may qualify for a 24-month STEM OPT extension.[27] An F-1 student approved for STEM OPT may not accrue an aggregate of more than 150 days of unemployment during a total OPT period. This includes the post-completion OPT period and subsequent 24-month STEM OPT extension period.[28]\n\nF-1 students with a bachelor’s degree, master’s degree, or doctorate degree in a field with a Department of Education’s Classification of Instructional Programs (CIP) code that appears on the DHS STEM Designated Degree Program List (PDF)[29] may apply to USCIS for authorization for a 24-month OPT extension (STEM OPT) by properly filing a Form I-765, after obtaining the DSO’s recommendation. This 24-month extension can only be granted once per qualifying degree. If the F-1 students do not fully use the extension, they are ineligible for any subsequent STEM extension.\n\nF-1 students may submit a properly filed Form I-765 up to 90 days before the",

If the F-1 students do not fully use the extension, they are ineligible for any subsequent STEM extension.\n\nF-1 students may submit a properly filed Form I-765 up to 90 days before the expiration of the F-1 student’s current post-completion OPT EAD and no more than 60 days after their DSO enters the STEM OPT recommendation into SEVIS. \n\nStudents who have timely and properly filed a Form I-765 for the 24-month OPT extension may continue working until the date of the USCIS written decision on the current Form I-765 or for up to 180 days after their current post-completion OPT expires, whichever is earlier.[30]\n\nIf USCIS approves the application, the F-1 student may continue working in accordance with the terms and conditions of the new EAD. If the extension is denied, employment authorization is immediately terminated and the F-1 student’s status ends in 60 days from the date of denial. However, if the application was denied because the student failed to maintain their F-1 status, they must immediately depart the United States.\n\nEligibility Requirements - Student\n\nTo be eligible for a STEM OPT extension, an F-1 student must:\n\nHave been granted OPT and currently be in a valid period of post-completion OPT;\nHave earned a bachelor’s, master’s, or doctoral degree from a school that is accredited by a U.S. Department of Education-recognized accrediting agency and is certified by ICE SEVP when the student submits the STEM OPT extension application;\nNot be in a multiple employer arrangement, or employed by a sole proprietorship, through a temp agency, through a consulting firm arrangement that provides labor for hire, or other similar relationships, if such arrangements are not bona-fide employer-employee relationships;\nBe employed for no less than 20 hours per week by each qualifying STEM OPT employer; and\nComplete an individualized Training Plan for STEM OPT Students (Form I-983) which identifies goals for the STEM practical training opportunity, including specific knowledge, skills, or techniques that will be imparted to the F-1 student; explains how those goals will be achieved through the work-based learning opportunity with the employer; describes a performance evaluation process; and describes methods of oversight and supervision. The Form I-983 must explain how the training is directly related to the student’s qualifying STEM degree.\nBefore the student’s DSO at the educational institution of the student’s most recent enrollment may recommend a 24-month OPT extension, the student must follow Form I-983 instructions, have an appropriate individual in the employer's organization sign the form, and submit Form I-983 to the DSO.\n\nPreviously Obtained STEM Degrees\n\nTo be eligible for a STEM OPT extension based on a previously earned degree, the following requirements at 8 CFR 214.2(f)(10)(ii)(C)(3) and (4) must be met:\n\nThe prior degree must be from a U.S. educational institution that is accredited by a Department of Education-recognized accrediting agency and SEVP-certified at the time of the DSO recommendation;\nThe prior degree must be on the DHS STEM Designated Degree List at the time of the DSO recommendation;\nThe prior degree must have been conferred within the 10 years preceding the DSO recommendation;\nThe prior degree must be directly related to the practical training opportunity; and\nThe student may not have previously received a STEM OPT extension based on the prior degree.\nFor example, if the student is currently participating in OPT based on completion of a non-STEM master’s degree, but previously received a bachelor’s degree in a field that appears on the DHS STEM Designated Degree Program List at the time of the DSO recommendation, the student may be able to apply for a STEM OPT extension based on the bachelor’s degree as long as it is from an accredited U.S. college or university and the OPT employment opportunity is directly related to the bachelor’s STEM degree.\n\nFuture STEM Degrees\n\nIf, in the future, an F-1 student enrolls in a new academic program and earns another qualifying STEM degree at a higher educational level, the student may be eligible for one additional 24-month STEM OPT extension, for a total of two lifetime STEM OPT extensions.\n\nFor example, if the student receives a 24-month STEM OPT extension based on a qualifying bachelor’s degree and the student later earns a qualifying STEM master’s degree, the student may apply for an additional 24-month STEM OPT extension based on the qualifying master’s degree.\n\nEligibility Requirements-Employer\n\nAn employer who wants to provide a practical training opportunity to a STEM OPT F-1 student during the student’s extension must:\n\nBe enrolled in E-Verify, as evidenced by either a valid E-Verify company identification number or, if the employer is using an employer agent to create its E-Verify cases, a valid E-Verify client company identification number;[31]\nRemain a participant in good standing with E-Verify, as determined by USCIS;[32]\nHave a valid Employer Identification Number issued by the Internal Revenue Service for tax purposes;[33]\nReport material changes of the F-1 student’s employment by submitting a modified Form I-983 to the DSO at the earliest available opportunity;[34]\nImplement a formal training program to augment the F-1 student’s academic learning through practical experience;[35]\nProvide an OPT opportunity that is commensurate with those of similarly situated U.S. workers in duties, hours, and compensation;[36] and\nIf applicable, report the F-1 student’s termination of employment or departure to the DSO within 5 business days.[37",

The employer that signs the Form I-983 must be the same entity that provides the practical training experience to the student.[43]\n\nTo establish a bona fide relationship, the employer may not be the F-1 student’s employer in name only, nor may the F-1 student work for the employer on a volunteer basis.[44]\n\nAn employer must have sufficient resources and trained or supervisory personnel available to provide appropriate training in connection with the specified training opportunity. These personnel must be located where the F-1 student’s practical training experience will take place, as specified in the Form I-983.\n\nThe personnel who may provide and supervise the training experience may be either employees of the employer, or contractors whom the employer has directly retained to provide services to the employer. However, employees or contractors of the employer’s clients or customers may not provide and supervise the training experience of the STEM OPT F-1 student. An F-1 student with OPT or a STEM OPT extension (who is undergoing training in their own right) is never considered qualified to train another F-1 student with a STEM OPT extension.\n\nEmployers may rely on their existing training programs or policies to satisfy the performance evaluation, oversight, and supervision requirements, but the F-1 student’s Form I-983 must nevertheless be customized for the individual F-1 student. Every Form I-983 must describe the direct relationship between the STEM OPT opportunity and the F-1 student’s qualifying STEM degree, as well as the relationship between the STEM OPT opportunity and the F-1 student’s goals and objectives for work-based learning.\n\nA STEM OPT employer may not assign, or otherwise delegate its training responsibilities to a non-employer third party (for example, a client or customer of the employer, employees of the client or customer, or contractors of the client or customer).\n\nDHS, at its discretion, may conduct a site visit of any STEM OPT employer to ensure that the employer possesses and maintains the ability, personnel, and resources to provide structured and guided work-based learning experiences consistent with the information provided on Form I-983.[45]\n\nDuring a site visit, DHS may verify that the employer that signed the Form I-983 is the same entity that is providing the practical training experience to the F-1 student and ensure compliance.\n\nFor DHS to effectively conduct these site visits as part of its oversight responsibilities, it is important that employers report any change in an F-1 student’s employment address. As indicated above and further explained below,[46] the employer and F-1 student must report such a material change by submitting a modified Form I-983 to the DSO at the earliest available opportunity.\n\nStaffing and temporary agencies and consulting firms may employ F-1 students under the STEM OPT program if they will be the entity that provides the practical training experience to the F-1 student and have and maintain a bona fide employer-employee relationship with the F-1 student.\n\nF-1 students may engage in a training experience that takes place at a site other than the employer’s principal place of business as long as all of the training obligations are met, including that the employer has and maintains a bona fide employer-employee relationship with the student.\n\nCertain types of arrangements, including multiple employer arrangements, sole proprietorships, employment through temp agencies, employment through consulting firm arrangements that provide labor for hire, and other similar relationships may not be able to demonstrate a bona fide employer-employee relationship and, therefore, may not meet the requirements of the STEM OPT extension.\n\nF-1 students seeking STEM OPT extensions may be employed by new start-up businesses so long as all regulatory requirements are met, including that the employer adheres to the training plan requirements, remains in good standing with E-Verify, will provide compensation to the STEM OPT student commensurate to that provided to similarly situated U.S. workers, and has the resources to comply with the proposed training plan.[47] For instance, alternative compensation may be allowed during a STEM OPT extension as long as the F-1 student can show that they are a bona fide employee and that their compensation, including any ownership interest in the employer entity (such as stock options), is commensurate with the compensation provided to other similarly situated U.S. workers.[48]\n\nAs part of the STEM OPT extension, employers must complete the appropriate parts of Form I-983. In this form, employers attest that:\n\nThey have enough resources and trained personnel available to appropriately train the F-1 student;\nThe F-1 student will not replace a full or part-time, temporary, or permanent U",

All STEM practical training opportunities require an initial evaluation within 12 months of the approved starting date on the EAD granted pursuant to the F-1 student’s 24-month OPT extension application, and a concluding evaluation. The F-1 student is responsible for ensuring the DSO receives the F-1 student’s 12-month evaluation and final evaluation no later than 10 days following the conclusion of the reporting period or conclusion of the student’s practical training opportunity, respectively.\n\nTraining Plan Modifications \n\nAn F-1 student on a STEM OPT extension also must:\n\nSubmit a Form I-983 to the student's DSO within 10 days of beginning a new practical training opportunity with a new employer during the student's 24-month OPT extension and subsequently obtain a new DSO recommendation;\nSign a modified Form I-983 reflecting any material changes or deviations from the training plan described in the Form I-983; and\nEnsure that that the modified Form I-983 is submitted to the F-1 student’s DSO at the earliest available opportunity.[53]\n4. OPT Reporting and Employment Requirements\nUnder 8 CFR 214.2(f)(12)(i), an F-1 student granted employment authorization by USCIS to engage in OPT must report to the DSO any change of name or address, or interruption of such employment for the duration of the student’s OPT. A DSO who recommends a student for OPT is responsible for updating the student’s record to reflect these reported changes for the duration of the time that practical training is authorized.\n\nTo maintain F-1 status, an F-1 student with an approved STEM OPT extension must also adhere to the following reporting requirements at 8 CFR 214.2(f)(10)(ii)(C)(7) and (9) and 8 CFR 214.2(f)(12)(ii):\n\nReport to the student’s DSO a change of legal name, residential or mailing address, employer name, employer address, and loss of employment within 10 days of the change;[54]\nComplete a validation report every 6 months, confirming that the legal name, residential or mailing address, employer name, employer address, and loss of employment has not changed. (The requirement for validation reporting starts on the date the 24-month STEM OPT extension begins, and ends when the F-1 student’s status expires or the 24-month STEM OPT extension concludes, whichever is first. The validation report is due to the F-1 student’s DSO within 10 business days of each reporting date.[55] The student must report this information to the DSO even if it is unchanged from the prior report. The validation confirms that the required information is still true and accurate.);\nSubmit an updated Form I-983 containing their self-evaluation of their progress toward the training goals described in the Form I-983.[56] (All required evaluations must be completed prior to the conclusion of a STEM practical training opportunity, and the F-1 student and an appropriate individual in the employer’s organization must sign each evaluation to attest to its accuracy.

The student’s employer must fill out a new Form I-983 to report to the DSO any material changes to, or material deviations from, the student’s formal training plan.\n\n5. OPT Filing\nEligible students may apply to USCIS for authorization of OPT employment by properly filing a Form I-765. Students need an EAD for each period of practical training.[59]\n\nThe student may not begin OPT until the date indicated on the student’s employment authorization document.[60] Employment authorization begins on the date the DSO requests or the date USCIS adjudicates the Form I-765, whichever is later.[61]\n\nPre-completion OPT\n\nA student may submit an application for pre-completion OPT no earlier than 90 days before being enrolled for one full academic year, provided that the period of employment will not start prior to the completion of the full academic year.[62] The student must file a properly completed Form I-765 after the student’s DSO enters the OPT recommendation into SEVIS.\n\nPost-completion OPT\n\nA student may apply for post-completion OPT no earlier than 90 days prior to the student’s program end date and no later than 60 days after the student’s program end-date. Within this 150-day window, the student must file a properly completed application no more than 30 days after the student’s DSO enters the OPT recommendation into SEVIS.\n\nA student is maintaining lawful nonimmigrant status while they are engaging in post-completion OPT. To resume full-time studies in a new educational program after a period of post-completion OPT, the student has to complete the transfer procedure.[63]\n\nIf post-completion OPT is denied, the student’s F-1 status expires 60 days from the date the degree program ends or the date of the denial, whichever is later. However, if the application is denied because the student failed to maintain F-1 status, they must immediately depart the United States.\n\nSTEM OPT\n\nA student may apply for a 24-month STEM OPT extension up to 90 days before the expiration of the student’s current post-completion OPT EAD and no more than 60 days after their DSO enters the STEM OPT recommendation into SEVIS.\n\nA student who has timely and properly filed a Form I-765 for the 24-month STEM OPT extension may continue working until the date of the USCIS written decision on the current Form I-765 or for up to 180 days after the student’s current post-completion OPT expires, whichever is earlier.[64]\n\nIf USCIS approves the application, the student may continue working in accordance with the terms and conditions of the new EAD. If the extension is denied and the student’s post-completion OPT EAD is expired, employment authorization is immediately terminated and the student’s status ends 60 days from the date of denial. If the extension is denied and the student’s post-completion OPT EAD is unexpired, the student will remain employment authorized until the expiration date of the EAD. However, if the application was denied because the student failed to maintain F-1 status, the student must immediately depart the United States.\n\nD. F-1 “Cap-gap” Extension\n1. Automatic “Cap-gap” Extension\nAn F-1 student who is the beneficiary of an H-1B[65] petition subject to the numerical limitations identified in INA 214(g)(1)(A)[66] and who requests a change of status is automatically granted an extension of F-1 status and employment authorization if:\n\nThe F-1 student is currently authorized for OPT employment;[67]\nThe F-1 student has not violated the terms and conditions of the student’s nonimmigrant status;[68]\nThe H-1B petition was timely filed;[69] and\nThe H-1B petition requested an H-1B employment start date of October 1 of the following fiscal year.[70]\nThe “cap-gap” period starts when an F-1 student’s status and employment authorization expires and, unless terminated, ends on October 1, the start date of the H-1B cap-subject petition filed on their behalf.\n\nCap-gap occurs because an employer may not file, and USCIS may not accept, a cap subject H-1B petition submitted more than 6 months in advance of the",

As a result, the earliest date that an employer can file an H-1B cap-subject petition is April 1 for the following fiscal year, which starts October 1. If USCIS approves the H-1B petition and the accompanying change of status request, the earliest date that the student may start the approved H-1B employment is October 1, but the beneficiary’s OPT employment authorization may expire before the H-1B start date.\n\nCurrent regulations allow certain F-1 students with a pending or approved cap-subject H-1B petition to remain in F-1 status during the cap-gap period. The regulations provide a way of filling the gap between the end of F-1 status and the beginning of H-1B status that might otherwise occur when F-1 status is not extended for qualifying students.\n\nOnce the listed requirements above are met, the automatic cap-gap extension begins and continues until October 1, or until the H-1B petition is rejected, denied, revoked, or withdrawn, or upon the denial or withdrawal of the request for change of nonimmigrant status, even if USCIS approves the H-1B petition filed on the F-1 student’s behalf for consular processing.[71] The F-2 status of dependents is also extended if the F-1 student’s status is extended. F-2s are not eligible for employment authorization.\n\nF-1 students who do not qualify for a cap-gap extension because they do not meet the requirements noted above, and whose periods of authorized stay expire before October 1, are required to leave the United States, apply for an H-1B visa at a consular post abroad, and seek readmission to the United States in H-1B status for the dates reflected on the approved H-1B petition.\n\nIf an H-1B cap-subject petition is filed on the behalf of an F-1 student who has entered the 60-day grace period, the F-1 student will receive the automatic cap-gap extension of the student’s F-1 status, but will not become employment-authorized (since the F-1 student was not employment-authorized at the time H-1B petition was filed, there is no employment authorization to be extended).\n\nUnemployment during the cap-gap automatic extension counts toward the 90-day (post- completion OPT) or 150-day (for STEM OPT extension) cumulative maximum allowed unemployment.\n\n2. Termination of Cap-gap Extension\nIf the student’s H-1B petition is rejected, denied, withdrawn, or revoked, or if the student’s change of status request is denied or withdrawn, the student has the standard 60-day grace period from the date of the rejection, denial, withdrawal, revocation notice, or the student’s program or OPT end date, whichever is later, to prepare for and depart the United States.[72]\n\nIf USCIS denies the H-1B change of status request due to a status violation, misrepresentation, or fraud, the F-1 student is ineligible for the cap-gap extension of status and the 60-day grace period. If USCIS revoked the H-1B petition based on a finding of a status violation, fraud, or misrepresentation discovered following approval, the 60-day grace period and cap-gap extension of status does not apply. In both of these instances, students are required to immediately leave the United States.\n\n3. Travel Outside the United States During the Cap-gap\nAn F-1 student may generally travel abroad and seek readmission to the United States in F-1 status during a cap-gap period if:\n\nUSCIS has approved the student’s H-1B petition and request for change of status;\nThe student seeks readmission before the student’s H-1B employment begins (normally at the beginning of the fiscal year on October 1); and\nThe student is otherwise admissible.[73]\nIf an F-1 student travels abroad while the application for change of status to H-1B is still pending, the change of status portion of the petition is deemed abandoned. If the H-1B petition on behalf of the student is approved, the student may apply for an H-1B visa from abroad.\n\nE. M-1 Practical Training\n1. Application\nPT is the only type of work authorization available to M-1 students.
