I. Executive Summary
DHS is amending its regulations by finalizing many of the provisions proposed in the “Modernizing H-1B Requirements, Providing Flexibility in the F-1 Program, and Program Improvements Affecting Other Nonimmigrant Workers,” notice of proposed rulemaking (NPRM), published in the Federal Register on October 23, 2023 (88 FR 72870) (https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2023/10/23/2023-23381/modernizing-h-1b-requirements-providing-flexibility-in-the-f-1-program-and-program-improvements). DHS previously finalized portions of the NPRM relating to H-1B registration in a separate final rule, “Improving the H-1B Registration Selection Process and Program Integrity,” published in the Federal Register on February 2, 2024 (89 FR 7456) (https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2024/02/02/2024-01770/improving-the-h-1b-registration-selection-process-and-program-integrity).

A. Purpose of the Regulatory Action
The purpose of this rulemaking is to modernize and improve the H-1B program by: (1) clarifying the requirements of the H-1B program and improving program efficiency; (2) providing greater benefits and flexibilities for petitioners and beneficiaries; and (3) strengthening program integrity measures.

B. Summary of the Major Provisions of the Regulatory Action
1. Clarifying Requirements and Improving Program Efficiencies
Through this rule, DHS is: (1) revising the regulatory definition and criteria for a position to be deemed a “specialty occupation”; (2) clarifying that “normally” does not mean “always” within the criteria for a specialty occupation; and (3) clarifying that the petitioner may accept a range of qualifying degree fields as sufficient to qualify for the position, but the required field(s) must be directly related to the job duties in order for the position to be deemed a specialty occupation. See new 8 CFR 214.2(h)(4)(ii) (https://www.ecfr.gov/current/title-8/chapter-I/subchapter-B/part-214/subpart-A/section-214.2#p-214.2(h)(4)(ii)) and (h)(4)(iii)(A) (https://www.ecfr.gov/current/title-8/chapter-I/subchapter-B/part-214/subpart-A/section-214.2#p-214.2(h)(4)(iii)(A)). DHS is also updating the regulations governing when an amended or new petition must be filed due to a change in an H-1B worker's place of employment to be consistent with current policy guidance.  See new 8 CFR 214.2(h)(2)(i)(E) (https://www.ecfr.gov/current/title-8/chapter-I/subchapter-B/part-214/subpart-A/section-214.2#p-214.2(h)(2)(i)(E)).

Additionally, DHS is codifying its current deference policy to clarify that, when adjudicating a Form I-129, Petition for Nonimmigrant Worker, involving the same parties and the same underlying facts, adjudicators generally should defer to a prior USCIS determination on eligibility, unless a material error in the prior approval is discovered or other material change or information impacts the petitioner's, beneficiary's, or applicant's eligibility. See new 8 CFR 214.1(c)(5) (https://www.ecfr.gov/current/title-8/chapter-I/subchapter-B/part-214/subpart-A/section-214.1#p-214.1(c)(5)). DHS is also updating the regulations to expressly require that evidence of the beneficiary's maintenance of status must be included with a petition seeking an extension or amendment of stay.  See new 8 CFR 214.1(c)(6) (https://www.ecfr.gov/current/title-8/chapter-I/subchapter-B/part-214/subpart-A/section-214.1#p-214.1(c)(6)). This policy impacts all employment-based nonimmigrant classifications that use Form I-129, Petition for Nonimmigrant Worker. DHS is also eliminating the itinerary requirement, impacting all H classifications.  See new 8 CFR 214.2(h)(2)(i)(B) (https://www.ecfr.gov/current/title-8/chapter-I/subchapter-B/part-214/subpart-A/section-214.2#p-214.2(h)(2)(i)(B)) and (F) (https://www.ecfr.gov/current/title-8/chapter-I/subchapter-B/part-214/subpart-A/section-214.2#p-214.2(h)(2)(i)(F)). Additionally, DHS is updating the regulations to allow petitioners to amend the initially requested validity periods (i.e., dates of employment) in cases where the petition is deemed approvable after the requested end date for employment has passed. See new 8 CFR 214.2(h)(9)(ii)(D) (https://www.ecfr.gov/current/title-8/chapter-I/subchapter-B/part-214/subpart-A/section-214.2#p-214.2(h)(9)(ii)(D)).

2. Providing Greater Benefits and Flexibilities
DHS is modernizing regulatory definitions to provide additional flexibilities for nonprofit and governmental research organizations and petitions for certain beneficiaries who are not directly employed by a qualifying organization. These changes better reflect modern organizational and staffing structures for both nonprofit and nongovernmental research organizations. Specifically, through this rulemaking, DHS is changing the definition of “nonprofit research organization” and “governmental research organization” by replacing the terms “primarily engaged” and “primary mission” with “fundamental activity” to permit nonprofit entities or governmental research organizations that conduct research as a fundamental activity, but are not primarily engaged in research or where research is not a primary mission, to meet the definition of a nonprofit research entity or governmental research organization for purposes of establishing exemption from the annual statutory limit on H-1B visas. Additionally, DHS is revising the regulations to recognize that certain beneficiaries may qualify for H-1B cap exemption when they are not directly employed by a qualifying organization, but still spend at least half of their time providing essential work that supports or advances a fundamental purpose, mission, objective, or function of the qualifying organization. See new 8 CFR 214.2(h)(8)(iii)(F) (https://www.ecfr.gov/current/title-8/chapter-I/subchapter-B/part-214/subpart-A/section-214.2#p-214.2(h)(8)(iii)(F)) (2)(iv), (h)(8)(iii)(F)(4), (h)(19)(iii)(B)(4), and (h)(19)(iii)(C). DHS is also providing flexibility to students seeking to change their status to H-1B by automatically extending the duration of their F-1 status, and any employment authorization granted under 8 CFR 274a.12(c)(3)(i)(B) (https://www.ecfr.gov/current/title-8/chapter-I/subchapter-B/part-274a/subpart-B/section-274a.12#p-274a.12(c)(3)(i)(B)) or (C) (https://www.ecfr.gov/current/title-8/chapter-I/subchapter-B/part-274a/subpart-B/section-274a.12#p-274a.12(c)(3)(i)(C)), until April 1 of the relevant fiscal year to avoid disruptions in lawful status and employment authorization while a petition requesting a change of status to H-1B is pending.  See new 8 CFR 214.2(f)(5)(vi)(A) (https://www.ecfr.gov/current/title-8/chapter-I/subchapter-B/part-214/subpart-A/section-214.2#p-214.2(f)(5)(vi)(A)).

3. Strengthening Program Integrity
DHS is strengthening the integrity of the H-1B program through this rulemaking by: (1) requiring that the petitioner establish that it has a bona fide position in a specialty occupation available for the beneficiary as of the requested start date; (2) codifying its authority to request contracts or similar evidence to determine if the position is bona fide; (3) ensuring that the LCA supports and properly corresponds to the petition; (4) revising the definition of “United States employer” by codifying current DHS policy that the petitioner have a bona fide job offer for the beneficiary to work within the United States as of the requested start date; and (5) adding a requirement that the petitioner have a legal presence and be amenable to service of process in the United States. See new 8 CFR 214.2(h)(4)(i)(B) (https://www.ecfr.gov/current/title-8/chapter-I/subchapter-B/part-214/subpart-A/section-214.2#p-214.2(h)(4)(i)(B)) (1), (h)(4)(ii), and (h)(4)(iv)(C) and (D).
DHS is also clarifying that certain owners of the petitioning entity may be eligible for H-1B status (“beneficiary-owners”), while setting reasonable parameters around H-1B eligibility when the beneficiary owns a controlling interest in the petitioning entity. For example, USCIS will limit the validity of the initial H-1B petition and first extension to 18 months each. See new 8 CFR 214.2(h)(9)(iii)(E) (https://www.ecfr.gov/current/title-8/chapter-I/subchapter-B/part-214/subpart-A/section-214.2#p-214.2(h)(9)(iii)(E)).
DHS is also codifying USCIS' authority to conduct site visits and clarifying that refusal to comply with site visits may result in denial or revocation of the petition. See new 8 CFR 214.2(h)(4)(i)(B) (https://www.ecfr.gov/current/title-8/chapter-I/subchapter-B/part-214/subpart-A/section-214.2#p-214.2(h)(4)(i)(B)) (2). Additionally, DHS is clarifying that if an H-1B worker will be staffed to a third party, meaning they will be contracted to fill a position in the third party's organization, the work to be performed by the beneficiary for the third party must be in a specialty occupation, and it is the requirements of that third party, and not the petitioner, that are most relevant when determining whether the position is a specialty occupation. See new 8 CFR 214.2(h)(4)(i)(B) (https://www.ecfr.gov/current/title-8/chapter-I/subchapter-B/part-214/subpart-A/section-214.2#p-214.2(h)(4)(i)(B)) (3).

C. Summary of Costs and Benefits
DHS analyzed two baselines for this final rule, the no action baselines and the without-policy baseline. The primary baseline for this final rule is the no action baseline. For the 10-year period of analysis of the final rule, DHS estimates the annualized net cost savings of this rulemaking will be $333,835 annualized at a 2 percent discount rate. DHS also estimates that there will be annualized monetized transfers of $1.4 million from newly cap-exempt petitioners to USCIS and $38.8 million from employers to F-1 workers, both annualized at a 2 percent discount rate.

D. Summary of Changes From the Notice of Proposed Rulemaking
Following careful consideration of public comments received, this final rule adopts many of the provisions proposed in the NPRM, with revisions as described below.

1. Specialty Occupation Definition and Criteria
In response to commenters' concerns, DHS is modifying the definition of specialty occupation from the proposed definition. After carefully considering the comments, DHS is not finalizing the proposed regulatory text, “[t]he required specialized studies must be directly related to the position,” as this language may be misread to conclude that USCIS would only consider a beneficiary's specialized studies in assessing whether the position is a specialty occupation. DHS is, however, retaining the “directly related” requirement in the definition of “specialty occupation” and related criteria, and is adding language clarifying that “directly related” means there is a logical connection between the degree or its equivalent, and the duties of the position.
The specialty occupation definition also clarifies that although the position may allow for a range of qualifying degree fields, each of the fields must be directly related to the duties of the position.
To address commenters' concerns about the potential for adjudicators to inappropriately rely solely on degree titles, DHS is removing the references to “business administration” and “liberal arts.” These changes recognize that the title of the degree alone is not determinative and that degree titles may differ among schools and evolve over time.
DHS is also making some minor, non-substantive revisions to 8 CFR 214.2(h)(4)(iii)(A) (https://www.ecfr.gov/current/title-8/chapter-I/subchapter-B/part-214/subpart-A/section-214.2#p-214.2(h)(4)(iii)(A)), which include: changing the word “are” to “is” in 8 CFR 214.2(h)(4)(iii)(A) (https://www.ecfr.gov/current/title-8/chapter-I/subchapter-B/part-214/subpart-A/section-214.2#p-214.2(h)(4)(iii)(A)) (4); revising 8 CFR 214.2(h)(4)(iii)(A) (https://www.ecfr.gov/current/title-8/chapter-I/subchapter-B/part-214/subpart-A/section-214.2#p-214.2(h)(4)(iii)(A)) (2) from “United States industry” to “industry in the United States”; and revising 8 CFR 214.2(h)(4)(iii)(A) (https://www.ecfr.gov/current/title-8/chapter-I/subchapter-B/part-214/subpart-A/section-214.2#p-214.2(h)(4)(iii)(A)) (2) and (3) by adding “to perform the job duties for” rather than just the word “position.”


2. Bar on Multiple Registrations Submitted by Related Entities
DHS will not finalize the proposed change at 8 CFR 214.2(h)(2)(i)(G) (https://www.ecfr.gov/current/title-8/chapter-I/subchapter-B/part-214/subpart-A/section-214.2#p-214.2(h)(2)(i)(G)) to expressly state in the regulations that related entities are prohibited from submitting multiple H-1B registrations for the same individual. On February 2, 2024, DHS published a final rule, “Improving the H-1B Registration Selection Process and Program Integrity,” 89 FR 7456 (https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2024/02/02/2024-01770/improving-the-h-1b-registration-selection-process-and-program-integrity) (Feb. 2, 2024), creating a beneficiary-centric selection process for registrations by employers and adding additional integrity measures related to the registration process to reduce the potential for fraud in the H-1B registration process. In that final rule, DHS states that it “intends to address and may finalize this proposed provision [expressly stating in the regulations that related entities are prohibited from submitting multiple registrations for the same individual] in a subsequent final rule,” but that “[m]ore time and data will help inform the utility of this proposed provision.” 89 FR 7456 (https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2024/02/02/2024-01770/improving-the-h-1b-registration-selection-process-and-program-integrity), 7469 (https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2024/02/02/2024-01770/improving-the-h-1b-registration-selection-process-and-program-integrity#page-7469) (Feb. 2, 2024). Initial data from the FY 2025 H-1B registration process show a significant decrease in the total number of registrations submitted compared to FY 2024, including a decrease in the number of registrations submitted on behalf of beneficiaries with multiple registrations.[1] This initial data indicate that there were far fewer attempts to gain an unfair advantage than in prior years owing, in large measure, to the implementation of the beneficiary-centric selection process.[2] Under the beneficiary-centric selection process, individual beneficiaries do not benefit from an increased chance of selection if related entities each submit a registration on their behalf. As such, DHS has decided not to finalize the proposed change pertaining to multiple registrations submitted by related entities.


3. Contracts
In response to stakeholder comments, DHS is revising 8 CFR 214.2(h)(4)(iv)(C) (https://www.ecfr.gov/current/title-8/chapter-I/subchapter-B/part-214/subpart-A/section-214.2#p-214.2(h)(4)(iv)(C)) to state that USCIS may request contracts or similar evidence “showing the bona fide nature of the beneficiary's position,” rather than “showing the terms and conditions of the beneficiary's work” as stated in the NPRM. This revision is intended to clarify that USCIS will review contracts or similar evidence to determine if the position is bona fide.


4. Non-Speculative or Bona Fide Employment
In response to a number of comments expressing concern with the term “non-speculative,” DHS is replacing “non-speculative” with “bona fide,” so that new 8 CFR 214.2(h)(4)(iii)(F) (https://www.ecfr.gov/current/title-8/chapter-I/subchapter-B/part-214/subpart-A/section-214.2#p-214.2(h)(4)(iii)(F)) will state, in relevant part, “[a]t the time of filing, the petitioner must establish that it has a bona fide position in a specialty occupation available for the beneficiary as of the start date of the validity period as requested on the petition.” This is not intended to be a substantive change, but to clarify what DHS meant by “non-speculative.” This provision is also consistent with current policy guidance that an H-1B petitioner must establish that the purported employment exists at the time of filing the petition and that it will employ the beneficiary in a specialty occupation.
DHS is also adding to this provision, “A petitioner is not required to establish specific day-to-day assignments for the entire time requested in the petition.” While this was previously noted in the preamble to the NPRM, DHS believes adding this clarification to the regulatory text will help allay commenters' concerns and avoid future confusion.


5. Beneficiary-Owners
In response to commenters' concerns about the term “controlling interest” in the regulatory text for beneficiary-owners, DHS is clarifying the term by defining it in the regulatory text, rather than only in the preamble. Specifically, DHS is adding to new 8 CFR 214.2(h)(4)(ii) (https://www.ecfr.gov/current/title-8/chapter-I/subchapter-B/part-214/subpart-A/section-214.2#p-214.2(h)(4)(ii)) and (h)(9)(iii)(E) (https://www.ecfr.gov/current/title-8/chapter-I/subchapter-B/part-214/subpart-A/section-214.2#p-214.2(h)(9)(iii)(E)), that a controlling interest means that the beneficiary owns more than 50 percent of the petitioner or that the beneficiary has majority voting rights in the petitioner.


6. Additional Changes
Additionally, in 8 CFR 214.1(c)(1) (https://www.ecfr.gov/current/title-8/chapter-I/subchapter-B/part-214/subpart-A/section-214.1#p-214.1(c)(1)), DHS is revising the reference to the fee regulation from 8 CFR 103.7 (https://www.ecfr.gov/current/title-8/chapter-I/subchapter-B/part-103/subpart-A/section-103.7) to 8 CFR 106.2 (https://www.ecfr.gov/current/title-8/chapter-I/subchapter-B/part-106/section-106.2), to align with the updated regulatory changes made by the USCIS Fee Schedule Final Rule.[3]

B. The H-1B Program
The H-1B nonimmigrant visa program allows U.S. employers to temporarily employ foreign workers in specialty occupations, defined by statute as occupations that require the theoretical and practical application of a body of highly specialized knowledge and a bachelor's or higher degree in the specific specialty, or its equivalent. See INA secs. 101(a)(15)(H)(i)(b) and 214(i), 8 U.S.C 1101(a)(15)(H)(i)(b) (https://www.govinfo.gov/content/pkg/USCODE-2023-title8/pdf/USCODE-2023-title8-chap12-subchapI-sec1101.pdf) and 1184(i) (https://www.govinfo.gov/content/pkg/USCODE-2023-title8/pdf/USCODE-2023-title8-chap12-subchapII-partII-sec1184.pdf). Through the Immigration Act of 1990, Public Law 101-649, Congress set the current annual cap for the H-1B visa category at 65,000,[5] which limits the number of beneficiaries who may be issued an initial H-1B visa or otherwise provided initial H-1B status each fiscal year.[6] Congress provided an exemption from the numerical limits in INA sec. 214(g)(1)(A), 8 U.S.C. 1184(g)(1)(A) (https://www.govinfo.gov/content/pkg/USCODE-2023-title8/pdf/USCODE-2023-title8-chap12-subchapII-partII-sec1184.pdf), for 20,000 initial H-1B visas, or grants of initial H-1B status, each fiscal year for foreign nationals who have earned a master's or higher degree from a U.S. institution of higher education (“advanced degree exemption”).[7] Congress also set up exemptions to the annual H-1B cap for workers who will be employed at an institution of higher education (as defined in section 101(a) of the Higher Education Act of 1965, as amended) or a related or affiliated nonprofit entity, and workers who will be employed at a nonprofit or governmental research organization. These exemptions are not numerically capped. See INA sec. 214(g)(5)(A)-(B), 8 U.S.C. 1184(g)(5)(A)-(B) (https://www.govinfo.gov/content/pkg/USCODE-2023-title8/pdf/USCODE-2023-title8-chap12-subchapII-partII-sec1184.pdf).

C. The F-1 Program
Section 101(a)(15)(F)(i) of the INA, 8 U.S.C. 1101(a)(15)(F)(i) (https://www.govinfo.gov/content/pkg/USCODE-2023-title8/pdf/USCODE-2023-title8-chap12-subchapI-sec1101.pdf), permits bona fide students to be temporarily admitted to the United States for the purpose of pursuing a full course of study at an established college, university, seminary, conservatory, academic high school, elementary school, or other academic institution or accredited language training program. Principal applicants are categorized as F-1 nonimmigrants and their spouses and minor children may accompany or follow to join them as F-2 dependents.
In 1992, legacy Immigration and Naturalization Service (INS) amended its longstanding regulations relating to an employment program for students called Optional Practical Training (OPT) such that students in F-1 nonimmigrant status who have been enrolled on a full-time basis for at least one full academic year in a college, university, conservatory, or seminary (which now must be certified by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement's (ICE) Student and Exchange Visitor Program (SEVP)) are allowed up to 12 months of OPT to work for a U.S. employer in a job directly related to the student's major area of study.[8] 8 CFR 214.2(f)(10) (https://www.ecfr.gov/current/title-8/chapter-I/subchapter-B/part-214/subpart-A/section-214.2#p-214.2(f)(10)). Employers of F-1 students under OPT often file petitions to change the students' status to H-1B so that they may continue working in their current or a similar job after completion of OPT. Many times, however, an F-1 student's OPT authorization would expire prior to the student being able to assume the employment specified in the approved H-1B petition, creating a gap in employment. In order to remedy this, in 2008, DHS created the “cap-gap” extension to temporarily extend the period of authorized stay and work authorization of certain F-1 students caught in the gap between the end of their OPT and the start date on their later-in-time approved, cap-subject H-1B petition.[9] 8 CFR 214.2(f)(5)(vi)(A) (https://www.ecfr.gov/current/title-8/chapter-I/subchapter-B/part-214/subpart-A/section-214.2#p-214.2(f)(5)(vi)(A)). The cap-gap extension provides a temporary bridge between F-1 and H-1B status, allowing students to remain in the United States between the end of their academic program and the beginning of the fiscal year, when the student's H-1B visa status commences. DHS subsequently amended the cap-gap provisions by extending the authorized period of stay and work authorization of any F-1 student who is the beneficiary of a timely filed cap-subject H-1B petition that has been granted by, or remains pending with, USCIS, until October 1 of the fiscal year for which H-1B visa classification has been requested.[10] 8 CFR 214.2(f)(5)(vi)(A) (https://www.ecfr.gov/current/title-8/chapter-I/subchapter-B/part-214/subpart-A/section-214.2#p-214.2(f)(5)(vi)(A)).

D. NPRM and Final Rules
On October 23, 2023, DHS published an NPRM, “Modernizing H-1B Requirements, Providing Flexibility in the F-1 Program, and Program Improvements Affecting Other Nonimmigrant Workers,” 88 FR 72870. In the NPRM, DHS stated that it may publish one or more final rules to codify the proposed provisions after carefully considering public comments. On February 2, 2024, DHS published, “Improving the H-1B Registration Selection Process and Program Integrity,” which finalized provisions of the NPRM related to the H-1B registration process.[11] Specifically, the final rule established a beneficiary centric selection process for H-1B registrations and new integrity measures, and provided start date flexibility for certain H-1B cap-subject petitions. That rule took effect on March 4, 2024, prior to the beginning of the registration period for the FY 2025 H-1B cap year. Through this subsequent rulemaking, DHS is finalizing many of the remaining provisions of the NPRM with the revisions described above and in the relevant sections below.




Statutory and Regulatory Requirements
A. Executive Order 12866 (https://www.federalregister.gov/executive-order/12866) (Regulatory Planning and Review) and Executive Order 13563 (https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2011/01/21/2011-1385/improving-regulation-and-regulatory-review) (Improving Regulation and Regulatory Review)
Executive Orders (E.O.) 12866 (Regulatory Planning and Review), as amended by Executive Order 14094 (https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2023/04/11/2023-07760/modernizing-regulatory-review) (Modernizing Regulatory Review), and 13563 (Improving Regulation and Regulatory Review) direct agencies to assess the costs and benefits of available regulatory alternatives and, if a regulation is necessary, to select regulatory approaches that maximize net benefits (including potential economic, environmental, public health and safety effects, distributive impacts, and equity). E.O. 13563 (https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2011/01/21/2011-1385/improving-regulation-and-regulatory-review) emphasizes the importance of quantifying both costs and benefits, of reducing costs, of harmonizing rules, and of promoting flexibility.
The Office of Management and Budget (OMB) has designated this final rule a “significant regulatory action” as defined under section 3(f) of E.O. 12866 (https://www.federalregister.gov/executive-order/12866), as amended by Executive Order 14094 (https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2023/04/11/2023-07760/modernizing-regulatory-review), but it is not significant under section 3(f)(1) because its annual effects on the economy do not exceed $200 million in any year of the analysis. Accordingly, OMB has reviewed this final rule.


1. Summary of Changes From NPRM to Final Rule
As discussed in the preamble, the purpose of this rulemaking is to modernize and improve the regulations governing the H-1B program by: (1) streamlining the requirements of the H-1B program and improving program efficiency; (2) providing greater benefits and flexibilities for petitioners and beneficiaries; and (3) improving integrity measures.
Following careful consideration of the public comments received, this final rule adopts the provisions proposed in the NPRM, with revisions as described above relating to 
Specialty Occupation Definition and Criteria, Bar on Multiple Registrations Submitted by Related Entities, Contracts, Bona fide employment,and Beneficiary-Owners.
DHS analyzed two baselines for this final rule, the no action baselines and the without-policy baseline. The primary baseline for this final rule is the no action baseline. For the 10-year period of analysis of the final rule DHS estimates the annualized net cost savings of this rulemaking will be $333,835 annualized at 2 percent. DHS also estimates that there will be annualized monetized transfers of $1.4 million from newly cap-exempt petitioners to USCIS and $38.8 million from other employees to F-1 workers, both annualized at a 2 percent discount rate. Table 1 provides a more detailed summary of the final rule provisions and their impacts.


2. Background
The purpose of this rulemaking is to modernize and improve the regulations relating to the H-1B program by: (1) streamlining the requirements of the H-1B program and improving program efficiency; (2) providing greater benefits and flexibilities for petitioners and beneficiaries; and (3) improving integrity measures. Some of the provisions will narrowly impact other nonimmigrant classifications.

3. Costs, Transfers, and Benefits of the Final Rule 
viii. Specialty Occupation Definition and Criteria 
In response to commenters' concerns, DHS is modifying the definition of specialty occupation. After carefully considering the comments, DHS is not finalizing the proposed regulatory text of “[t]he required specialized studies must be directly related to the position,” as this language may be misread as stating that USCIS would only consider a beneficiary's specialized studies. The “directly related” requirement is, however, being retained in the definition of “specialty occupation” and in the criteria.
DHS is also adding regulatory text to clarify the level of connection needed to meet the “directly related” requirement by adding the sentence, “directly related means that there is a logical connection between the degree, or its equivalent, and the duties of the position,” to the regulatory text. Further, DHS is adding a reference to the “duties of the position” to the prior sentence about allowing a range of qualifying degree fields to assure stakeholders that this practice has not changed.
To address commenters' various concerns about not relying on degree titles, DHS is removing the references to “business administration” and “liberal arts.” These changes recognize that title of the degree, alone, is not determinative and that titles may differ among schools and evolve over time.
DHS is also making some minor, non-substantive revisions to 8 CFR 214.2(h)(4)(iii)(A) (https://www.ecfr.gov/current/title-8/chapter-I/subchapter-B/part-214/subpart-A/section-214.2#p-214.2(h)(4)(iii)(A)), which include: changing the word “are” to “is” in 8 CFR 214.2(h)(4)(iii)(A) (https://www.ecfr.gov/current/title-8/section-214.2#p-214.2(h)(4)(iii)(A)) (4); revising 8 CFR 214.2(h)(4)(iii)(A) (https://www.ecfr.gov/current/title-8/chapter-I/subchapter-B/part-214/subpart-A/section-214.2#p-214.2(h)(4)(iii)(A)) (2) from “United States industry” to “industry in the United States”; and revising 8 CFR 214.2(h)(4)(iii)(A) (https://www.ecfr.gov/current/title-8/chapter-I/subchapter-B/part-214/subpart-A/section-214.2#p-214.2(h)(4)(iii)(A)) (2) and (3) by adding “to perform the job duties for” rather than just the word “position”.
Relative to the no-action baseline, this change has no costs associated with it, and there may be transparency benefits due to this change. Relative to the without-policy baseline petitioners may have taken time to provide position descriptions or other evidence of connection between a degree, or its equivalent, and the duties of the position.


ix. Amended Petitions
DHS is clarifying when an amended or new H-1B petition must be filed due to a change in an H-1B worker's place of employment. Specifically, this rule will clarify that any change of work location that requires a new LCA is itself considered a material change and therefore requires the petitioning employer to file an amended or new petition with USCIS before the H-1B worker may perform work under the changed conditions.
This change will clarify requirements for H-1B amended petitions by codifying Matter of Simeio Solutions, LLC [174] and incorporating DOL rules on when a new LCA is not necessary. DHS estimates that this change will save petitioners filing amended petitions 5 minutes for each petition (0.08 hours). 
USCIS received a low of 64,385 amended petitions in FY 2019, and a high of 77,255 amended petitions in FY 2023. Based on the 5-year annual average, DHS estimates that 71,141 petitioners file for an amended petition each year shown in Table 3. DHS does not know if all of these amended petitions are due to a change in an H-1B worker's place of employment. Because of this, DHS cannot estimate how many of these new and amended petitions will benefit by consolidating existing requirements and providing clearer regulatory text pertaining to when a petitioner must submit an amended or new petition with or without a new LCA.
DHS conducted a sensitivity analysis to estimate the number of petitions that may benefit from this change. Table 4 presents the lower and upper bound number of petitions filed annually for amended petitions and for new petitions, which corresponds to a range of 10 to 90 percent.
Using the lower and upper bounds of the estimated annual population for the petitioners who will file amended petitions, DHS estimates the cost savings based on the opportunity cost of time of gathering and submitting information by multiplying the estimated time burden savings for those filing an amended petition (5 minutes or 0.08 hours) by the compensation rate of an HR specialist, in-house lawyer, or outsourced lawyer, respectively.
In order to estimate the opportunity costs of time for completing and filing an H-1B amended petition DHS assumes that a petitioner will use an HR specialist, an in-house lawyer, or an outsourced lawyer to prepare an H-1B amended petition.[175] DHS uses the mean hourly wage of $36.57 for HR specialists to estimate the opportunity cost of the time for preparing and submitting the H-1B amended petition.[176] Additionally, DHS uses the mean hourly wage of $84.84 for in-house lawyers to estimate the opportunity cost of the time for preparing and submitting the H-1B amended petition.[177]
DHS accounts for worker benefits when estimating the total costs of compensation by calculating a benefits-to-wage multiplier using the BLS report detailing the average employer costs for employee compensation for all civilian workers in major occupational groups and industries. DHS estimates that the benefits-to-wage multiplier is 1.45 and, therefore, is able to estimate the full opportunity cost per petitioner, including employee wages and salaries and the full cost of benefits such as paid leave, insurance, retirement, etc.[178] DHS multiplied the average hourly U.S. wage rate for HR specialists and in-house lawyers by 1.45 to account for the full cost of employee benefits, for a total of $53.03 [179] per hour for an HR specialist and $123.02 [180] per hour for an in-house lawyer. DHS recognizes that a firm may choose, but is not required, to outsource the preparation of these petitions and, therefore, presents two wage rates for lawyers. To determine the full opportunity costs of time if a firm hired an outsourced lawyer, DHS multiplied the average hourly U.S. wage rate for lawyers by 2.5 for a total of $212.10 to approximate an hourly cost for an outsourced lawyer to prepare and submit an H-1B amended petition or LCA.[181]
DHS does not know the exact number of petitioners who will choose an in-house or an outsourced lawyer but assumes it may be a 50/50 split and therefore provides an average. Table 5 shows that the total annual cost savings will range from $77,111 to $694,006. DHS estimates the total cost savings to be the average between the lower bound and the upper bound estimates. Based on this, DHS estimates the average cost savings from this provision to be $385,559.



x. Deference to Prior USCIS Determinations of Eligibility in Requests for Extensions of Petition Validity
DHS is codifying and clarifying its existing deference policy at amended 8 CFR 214.1(c)(5) (https://www.ecfr.gov/current/title-8/chapter-I/subchapter-B/part-214/subpart-A/section-214.1#p-214.1(c)(5)). Deference has helped promote consistency and efficiency for both USCIS and its stakeholders. The deference policy instructs officers to consider prior determinations involving the same parties and facts, when there is no material error with the prior determination, no material change in circumstances or in eligibility, and no new material information adversely impacting the petitioner's, applicant's, or beneficiary's eligibility. This provision is codifying the deference policy [182] dated April 27, 2021. Relative to the no-action baseline there are no costs to the public. The benefit of codifying this policy is that there may be some transparency benefits to having the policy in the CFR. Relative to a without-policy baseline petitioners may need to take time to familiarize themselves with those changes made in the 2021 deference policy memo. The provision applies to all nonimmigrant classifications for which form I-129 is filed to request an extension of stay (i.e., E-1, E-2, E-3, H-1B, H-1B1, H-2A, H-2B, H-3, L-1, O-1, O-2, P-1, P-1S, P-2, P-2S, P-3, P-3S, Q-1, R-1, and TN nonimmigrant classifications). The deference policy had been in effect since 2004 but was rescinded in 2017 until 2021, when it was reinstated in the USCIS Policy Manual. After USCIS rescinded deference in 2017, the number of RFEs and denials increased.
DHS will codify the deference policy that applies to the adjudication of a petition. Relative to a without-policy baseline, this change could affect the number of RFEs that USCIS sends for Form I-129. USCIS estimates that there may be a reduction in RFEs, as officers adjudicating a Form I-129 involving the same parties and the same underlying facts will typically be able to defer to a prior approval, given there is no new material information or a material error. The reduction in RFEs may save time and make the overall process faster for petitioners and USCIS.
DHS conducted a sensitivity analysis to estimate the number of petitions that may benefit from codifying and clarifying its existing deference policy. Table 8 presents the lower and upper bound number of petitions filed annually for amended petitions and for new petitions, which corresponds to a range of 10 to 90 percent.
Using the lower and upper bounds of the estimated annual population for the petitioners who may no longer have to provide duplicative data, DHS estimates the cost savings based on the opportunity cost of time of gathering and submitting duplicative information by multiplying the estimated time burden to gather information 10 minutes (0.167 hours) by the compensation rate of an HR specialist, in-house lawyer, or outsourced lawyer, respectively. DHS does not know the exact number of petitioners who will choose an in-house or an outsourced lawyer but assumes it may be a 50/50 split and therefore provides an average.


xi. Evidence of Maintenance of Status
DHS is clarifying current requirements and codifying practices concerning evidence of maintenance of status at 8 CFR 214.1(c)(1) (https://www.ecfr.gov/current/title-8/chapter-I/subchapter-B/part-214/subpart-A/section-214.1#p-214.1(c)(1)) through (7) (https://www.ecfr.gov/current/title-8/chapter-I/subchapter-B/part-214/subpart-A/section-214.1#p-214.1(c)(7)). Primarily, DHS seeks to clarify that evidence of maintenance of status is required for petitions where there is a request to extend or amend the beneficiary's stay.
This change will list examples of additional evidence types that petitioners may provide but will not limit petitioners to those specific evidence types. The form instructions further state that if the beneficiary is employed in the United States, the petitioner may submit copies of the beneficiary's last two pay stubs, Form W-2, and other relevant evidence, as well as a copy of the beneficiary's Form I-94, passport, travel document, or Form I-797. This change may decrease the number of RFEs and NOIDs by clearly stating what types of supporting documentation are relevant and clarifying that petitioners should submit such supporting documentation upfront, rather than waiting for USCIS to issue a request for additional information. This may benefit petitioners by saving them the time to review and respond to RFEs and NOIDs.
DHS is codifying into regulation the instructions that, when seeking an extension or amendment of stay, the applicant or petitioner must submit supporting evidence to establish that the applicant or beneficiary maintained the previously accorded nonimmigrant status before the extension or amendment request was filed. Additionally, DHS will remove the sentence: “Supporting evidence is not required unless requested by the director.”  See amended 8 CFR 214.2(h)(14) (https://www.ecfr.gov/current/title-8/chapter-I/subchapter-B/part-214/subpart-A/section-214.2#p-214.2(h)(14)). See also amended 8 CFR 214.2(l)(14)(i) (https://www.ecfr.gov/current/title-8/chapter-I/subchapter-B/part-214/subpart-A/section-214.2#p-214.2(l)(14)(i)) (removing “Except in those petitions involving new offices, supporting documentation is not required, unless requested by the director.”); amended 8 CFR 214.2(o)(11) and amended 8 CFR 214.2(p)(13) (removing “Supporting documents are not required unless requested by the director.”). DHS expects that these changes will reduce confusion for applicants and petitioners, clarify what evidence is required for all extension or amendment of stay requests, and simplify adjudications by decreasing the need for RFEs and NOIDs.


xii. Eliminating the Itinerary Requirement for H Programs
DHS will eliminate the H programs' itinerary requirement. See amended 8 CFR 214.2(h)(2)(i)(B) (https://www.ecfr.gov/current/title-8/chapter-I/subchapter-B/part-214/subpart-A/section-214.2#p-214.2(h)(2)(i)(B)) and (F) (https://www.ecfr.gov/current/title-8/chapter-I/subchapter-B/part-214/subpart-A/section-214.2#p-214.2(h)(2)(i)(F)). Current 8 CFR 214.2(h)(2)(i)(B) (https://www.ecfr.gov/current/title-8/chapter-I/subchapter-B/part-214/subpart-A/section-214.2#p-214.2(h)(2)(i)(B)) states that “A petition that requires services to be performed or training to be received in more than one location must include an itinerary with the dates and locations of the services or training and must be filed with USCIS as provided in the form instructions.” In addition, current 8 CFR 214.2(h)(2)(i)(F) (https://www.ecfr.gov/current/title-8/chapter-I/subchapter-B/part-214/subpart-A/section-214.2#p-214.2(h)(2)(i)(F)) contains additional language requiring an itinerary for H petitions filed by agents as the petitioner.
DHS recognizes this change may affect H-1B petitioners filing for beneficiaries performing services in more than one location and submitting itineraries.[184] 
However, due to the absence of detailed data on petitioners submitting itineraries, DHS estimates the affected population as the estimated number of petitions filed annually for workers placed at off-site locations. DHS assumes the petitions filed for workers placed at off-site locations are likely to indicate that beneficiaries may be performing services at multiple locations and, therefore, petitioners are likely to submit itineraries. Eliminating the itinerary requirement will reduce petitioner burden and promote more efficient adjudications, without compromising program integrity. This change may benefit petitioners who have beneficiaries at alternative worksites.


xiii. Validity Period Expires Before Adjudication
DHS will allow H-1B petitions to be approved or have their requested validity period dates extended if USCIS adjudicates and deems the petition approvable after the initially requested validity period end-date, or the period for which eligibility has been established, has passed. This typically will happen if USCIS deemed the petition approvable upon a favorable motion to reopen, motion to reconsider, or appeal.
If USCIS adjudicates an H-1B petition and deems it approvable after the initially requested validity period end-date, or the last day for which eligibility has been established, USCIS may issue an RFE asking whether the petitioner wants to update the dates of intended employment. This change may increase the number of RFE's; however, it may save petitioners from having to file another H-1B petition and USCIS from having to intake and adjudicate another petition.
If in response to the RFE the petitioner confirms that it wants to update the dates of intended employment and submits a different LCA that corresponds to the new requested validity dates, even if that LCA was certified after the date the H-1B petition was filed, and assuming all other eligibility criteria are met, USCIS will approve the H-1B petition for the new requested period or the period for which eligibility has been established, as appropriate, rather than require the petitioner to file a new or amended petition. Under a no-action baseline, the requirement to file an amended or new petition results in additional filing costs and burden for the petitioner. DHS expects that this change will save petitioners the difference between the opportunity cost of time and the fee to file an additional form, and the nominal opportunity cost of time and expense associated with responding to the RFE. This change will benefit beneficiaries selected under the cap, who will retain cap-subject petitions while their petition validity dates are extended or whose petitions now may be approved rather than denied based on this technicality.


xiv. H-1B Cap Exemptions
DHS is revising the requirements to qualify for H-1B cap exemption when a beneficiary is not directly employed by a qualifying institution, organization, or entity at 8 CFR 214.2(h)(8)(iii)(F) (https://www.ecfr.gov/current/title-8/chapter-I/subchapter-B/part-214/subpart-A/section-214.2#p-214.2(h)(8)(iii)(F)) (4). These final changes intend to clarify, simplify, and modernize eligibility for cap-exempt H-1B employment, so that they are less restrictive and better reflect modern employment relationships. The changes also intend to provide additional flexibility to petitioners to better implement Congress's intent to exempt from the annual H-1B cap certain H-1B beneficiaries who are employed at a qualifying institution, organization, or entity.
DHS is revising 8 CFR 214.2(h)(19)(iii)(C) (https://www.ecfr.gov/current/title-8/chapter-I/subchapter-B/part-214/subpart-A/section-214.2#p-214.2(h)(19)(iii)(C)), which states that a nonprofit research organization is an entity that is “primarily engaged in basic research and/or applied research,” and a governmental research organization is a Federal, State, or local entity “whose primary mission is the performance or promotion of basic research and/or applied research.” DHS is replacing “primarily engaged” and “primary mission” with “a fundamental activity” in order to permit a nonprofit entity or governmental organization that conducts research as a fundamental activity but is not primarily engaged in research to meet the definition of a nonprofit research entity or a governmental research organization. This will likely increase the population of petitioners who are now eligible for the cap exemption and, by extension, will likely increase the number of petitions that may be cap-exempt.
Petitioners who qualify for a cap exemption for their employees under the final rule will no longer have to register for the cap lottery or pay the $215 registration fee. Some affected petitioners may avoid ACWIA fees that would have been applicable to their initial cap-subject petitions. While DHS does not have administrative data to estimate precisely how many additional petitioners will now qualify for these cap exemptions, the RIA presented estimates that the modest expansion in I-129 petitions and approved beneficiaries results from cap-subject registrants, many of whom would not have been randomly selected in the lottery, become eligible to petition directly for cap-exempt researchers.
Aside from the reduction in transfers from not having to pay the registration fee, petitioners that qualify under the cap exemptions will also benefit from not having to wait for H-1B cap season to commence employment. This may allow approved petitioners to have their H-1B workers commence employment earlier, prior to the beginning of the fiscal year on October 1.
The National Science Foundation's (NSF) Nonprofit Research Activities (NPRA) Survey of nonfarm businesses filing IRS tax form 990 as tax-exempt organizations with payroll of $500,00 or more, estimated there were 2,835 nonprofits with research and development (R&D) activity accounting for $27B in FY2021 R&D expenditures.[186] 
This equals $9.6M R&D expenditures per nonprofit with R&D activity in 2021.[187] 
The largest share of nonprofits' R&D expenditures were made possible by Federal Government funds (43%), followed by other sources of funds (30%) and internal funds (28%). While data on the specific activities of individual research nonprofits is not available to DHS or the public, NSF NPRA Tables 1, 2, and 3 show that R&D as a share of a research nonprofits' expenditures vary widely. For example, while comparable amounts were spent on research activities by nonprofits in the science and technology (S&T) sector and the healthcare sector ($21M and $22M, respectively), these expenditures comprise 53% of a typical S&T nonprofit's expenditures, but only 2% of a typical healthcare nonprofit's total expenditures.[188] 
Other research nonprofits outside the S&T or healthcare sectors spent less on research activities ($1M or 5% of total expenditures), but outnumbered both S&T and healthcare sectors combined (1,660 “other nonprofit organizations” compared to 514 S&T and 658 healthcare nonprofits with R&D activity). NPRA Tables 8 through 11 show similar results for research employees as a share of total employees (R&D employees comprise 55,527 FTE or 68% of the 81,241 employees of S&T organizations with R&D activity, compared with 2% for healthcare organizations with R&D activity and 8% of other nonprofit organizations with R&D activities. NPRA Table 11 provides additional detail on the mix of researchers, technicians and other support personnel employed to support nonprofits' research activities.
Given the highly competitive nature of the market for research funding, DHS assumes R&D funding is unlikely to be awarded to nonprofits that do not already employ the highly skilled, highly specialized staff required to successfully carry out research requirements.[189] 
Consequently, any impacts to nonprofits that do not already employ skilled/specialized labor would be constrained by the difficulty of competing for research funding before petitioning for qualified researchers or petitioning for qualified researchers before competing for research funding. A national immigration law-firm with significant experience provided comments agreeing a more significant difference in the number of petitions that fit the parameters of cap exempt eligibility is unlikely.
Furthermore, NSF's NPRA Table 7 shows $0.32 for every $1 of FY2021 nonprofit organizations' research expenditures flowing out in the form of grants, subcontracts or subawards to support R&D by other organizations. While neither DHS nor NSF know the degree to which research activities' employment is structured around interpretations of DHS's requirement of employment at the cap-exempt entity, NPRA Table 7 depicts a highly interconnected research enterprise in which research activities flow between other organizations with research activities.[190] 
A practical impact of the definition change could be additional flexibility for research organizations and foreign researchers when determining the appropriate employer. For this reason, these changes are assumed to represent a shift from currently cap-exempt organizations to newly exempt organizations rather than a true expansion in the population of cap-exempt visas. DHS agrees, however, with information submitted by a commenter representing postdocs and research organizations that the change “diversif[ies] international postdocs' available career paths” and therefore could result in an expansion if cap-exempt H-1B workers' research careers gradually extend more broadly throughout the research enterprise as a result of this flexibility.
In the NPRM, the RIA estimated these modest impacts would accrue to cap subject registrants seeking highly skilled, highly specialized research staff.[191] 
DHS's assessment that a larger response is unlikely is supported by several factors. Cap subject petitioners have always had the option to access cap-exempt researchers by creating separate research nonprofits or partnerships with cap-exempt universities and research organizations. DHS's high-end estimate, 2,845 additional cap exempt visas, is just higher than the NSF estimated number of nonprofits with R&D activity in FY2021.
Commenters provided no information nor substantive critique of the NPRM RIA's estimated impact, incorrectly alleged no rationale for the proposed changes, and contradicted the NSF NPRA data in asserting, without evidence, that “all nonprofits do some activity they could labeled as or considered to be research [sic]” and, therefore the change would “bust the statutory cap wide open.” In the absence of information, DHS includes the monetized impacts of 0.3-0.8 percent of cap-subject registrants becoming cap-exempt.
Relative to the No-Action baseline where most registrants will not ultimately be selected in the random lottery to petition using Form I-129 H-1B, the estimated 0.3-0.8 percent expansions in cap-exempt research non-profits result in reduced registrations as well as additional Form I-129 H-1B filings and fees from non-profits made exempt by this final rule that would not have been selected in the lottery. These newly cap-exempt Form I-129 fees are discounted from $780 to $460 and the Asylum Program fees are discounted from $600 to $300 consistent with research non-profits.[192] 


xv. Automatic Extension of Authorized Employment “Cap-Gap”
DHS is extending the automatic cap-gap extension at 8 CFR 214.2(f)(5)(vi) (https://www.ecfr.gov/current/title-8/chapter-I/subchapter-B/part-214/subpart-A/section-214.2#p-214.2(f)(5)(vi)). Currently, the automatic extension is valid only until October 1 of the fiscal year for which H-1B status is being requested, but DHS extends this until April 1 of the fiscal year. 
See amended 8 CFR 214.2(f)(5)(vi) (https://www.ecfr.gov/current/title-8/chapter-I/subchapter-B/part-214/subpart-A/section-214.2#p-214.2(f)(5)(vi)). This change will result in more flexibility for both students and USCIS and will help to avoid disruption to U.S. employers that are lawfully employing F-1 students while a qualifying H-1B cap-subject petition is pending.
Each year, a number of U.S. employers seek to employ F-1 students via the H-1B program by requesting a COS and filing an H-1B cap petition with USCIS. Many F-1 students complete a program of study or post-completion OPT in mid-spring or early summer. Per current regulations, after completing their program or post-completion OPT, F-1 students have 60 days to take the steps necessary to maintain legal status or depart the United States. 
See8 CFR 214.2(f)(5)(iv) (https://www.ecfr.gov/current/title-8/chapter-I/subchapter-B/part-214/subpart-A/section-214.2#p-214.2(f)(5)(iv)). However, because the change to H-1B status cannot occur earlier than October 1, an F-1 student whose program or post-completion OPT expires in mid-spring has two or more months following the 60-day period before the authorized period of H-1B status begins.
Under current regulations, the automatic cap-gap extension is valid only until October 1 of the fiscal year for which H-1B status is being requested. DHS is changing the automatic extension end date from October 1 to April 1 to avoid disruptions in employment authorization that some F-1 nonimmigrants awaiting the change to H-1B status have been experiencing over the past several years. Table 18 shows the historical pending petition volumes, for F-1 nonimmigrants awaiting H-1B status. Preventing such employment disruptions will also benefit employers of F-1 nonimmigrants with cap-gap extensions. This change in the automatic extension end date will also allow USCIS greater flexibility in allocating officer resources to complete adjudications without the pressure of completing as many change of status (COS) requests as possible before October 1.
DHS does not have precise data on the number of cap-gap F-1 nonimmigrants who have faced EAD disruptions. Using available administrative data, DHS estimated in the NPRM that between 1 and 5 percent of F-1 nonimmigrants seeking a change of status to H-1B may have faced EAD disruptions.
Current regulations allow OPT F-1 students 60 days to take the steps necessary to maintain legal status or depart the United States. See8 CFR 214.2(f)(5)(iv) (https://www.ecfr.gov/current/title-8/chapter-I/subchapter-B/part-214/subpart-A/section-214.2#p-214.2(f)(5)(iv)). However, because the change to H-1B status cannot occur earlier than October 1, an F-1 student whose program or post-completion OPT expires in mid-spring has two or more months following the 60-day period before the authorized period of H-1B status begins. While many F-1 students complete a program of study or post-completion OPT in mid-spring or early summer, some complete their programs at different times of the year, with 60-day grace periods. Additionally, some F-1 nonimmigrants with pending H-1B petitions may not have intended to work during the full period covered by this provision. The labor impacts of this provision of the rule would be constrained in these and other instances not readily available in USCIS's administrative data.
DHS estimates that this change will benefit up to 5 percent (1,348) of the population (26,961) on an annual basis and on the low end 270 (1 percent); however, F-1 students who are beneficiaries of H-1B cap petitions that provide cap-gap relief will be able to avoid employment disruptions while waiting to obtain H-1B status. DHS estimates that an F-1 student who is the beneficiary of an H-1B cap petition makes $46.14 [193] per hour in compensation. This compensation includes wages and salaries, benefits such as paid leave and insurance, and legally required benefits such as Social Security and Medicare.[194]
Based on a 40-hour work week,[195] DHS estimates the potential compensation for each F-1 student who is the beneficiary of an H-1B cap petition to be $47,996 [196] for 6 months of employment from October 1st to April 1st. DHS estimates that this potential compensation may be a benefit to F-1 students who are seeking a COS to a H-1B status. This benefit ranges from $12,958,920 [197]  to $64,698,608 [198] annually, with a midpoint of $38,828,764. This midpoint is the primary estimate of transfer payments from other workers to F-1 students who remain employed up to six months longer than under current regulations, in the form of increased compensation during the additional duration of employment. Employers will benefit, as they will be gaining productivity and potential profits that the F-1 students' continuing employment will provide. Companies may also benefit by not incurring opportunity costs associated with the next best alternative to the immediate labor the F-1 student will provide. DHS does not know what this next best alternative may be for impacted companies. For instance, in the absence of F-1 workers providing this labor, employers may redistribute the work to their other workers either as a part of their regular job duties or require them to work overtime, or companies may need to reprioritize the work, or put off certain work until a later time.
There may be additional transfers due to tax impacts associated with this compensation, but these transfers are difficult to quantify. Foreign students in F-1 status more than five calendar years are typically liable for Social Security and Medicare taxes [199] in addition to Federal and State income taxes.


xvi. Provisions To Ensure Bona Fide Job Offer for a Specialty Occupation Position
a. Contracts
DHS will codify USCIS' authority to request contracts, work orders, or similar evidence. 
See amended 8 CFR 214.2(h)(4)(iv)(C) (https://www.ecfr.gov/current/title-8/chapter-I/subchapter-B/part-214/subpart-A/section-214.2#p-214.2(h)(4)(iv)(C)). Such evidence may take the form of contracts or legal agreements, if available, or other evidence including technical documentation, milestone tables, or statements of work. Evidence submitted should show the contractual relationship between all parties, the bona fide nature of the beneficiary's position, and the minimum educational requirements to perform the duties.
While USCIS already has the authority to request contracts and other similar evidence, DHS is amending the regulations for added clarity. By codifying this authority, USCIS is putting stakeholders on notice of the kinds of evidence that could be requested to establish the nature of the beneficiary's work and the minimum educational requirements to perform the duties. This evidence, in turn, could establish that the petitioner has a bona fide job offer for a specialty occupation position for the beneficiary. Relative to the no-action baseline, this change has no costs associated with it, and there may be transparency benefits due to this change. Relative to the without-policy baseline petitioners may have taken time to provide contracts or legal agreements, if available, or other evidence including technical documentation, milestone tables, or statements of work. DHS cannot estimate how much time it will have taken for petitioners to provide that information.

b. Bona Fide Employment
DHS will codify its requirement that the petitioner must establish, at the time of filing, that it has a bona fide position in a specialty occupation available for the beneficiary as of the start date of the validity period as requested on the petition. See8 CFR 214.2(h)(4)(iv)(D) (https://www.ecfr.gov/current/title-8/chapter-I/subchapter-B/part-214/subpart-A/section-214.2#p-214.2(h)(4)(iv)(D)). This change is consistent with current USCIS policy guidance that an H-1B petitioner must establish that the purported employment exists at the time of filing the petition and that it will employ the beneficiary in a specialty occupation.[200] Relative to the no-action baseline, this change has no costs associated with it, and there may be transparency benefits due to this change. Relative to the without-policy baseline petitioners may require time to provide documentation to establish that their position was a bona fide position in a specialty occupation. DHS cannot estimate how much time it takes for petitioners to provide that information.

c. LCA Corresponds With the Petition
DHS will update the regulations to expressly include DHS's existing authority to ensure that the LCA supports and properly corresponds with the accompanying H-1B petition. Relative to the no-action baseline, this change has no costs and may yield transparency benefits due to consistency between regulation and current policy. Relative to the without-policy baseline petitioners may have taken time to provide their LCA to DHS, however DHS cannot estimate how much time it will have taken for petitioners to provide that information.

d. Revising the Definition of U.S. Employer
DHS is revising the definition of “United States employer.” First, DHS will eliminate the employer-employee relationship requirement. In place of the employer-employee relationship requirement, DHS will codify the requirement that the petitioner has a bona fide job offer for the beneficiary to work, which may include telework, remote work, or other off-site work within the United States. DHS also will replace the requirement that the petitioner “[e]ngages a person to work within the United States” with the requirement that the petitioner have a legal presence and is amenable to service of process in the United States. Relative to the no-action baseline, this change has no costs associated with it, and there may be transparency benefits due to this change. Relative to the without-policy baseline, petitioners may require time to provide documentation establishing a bona fide job offer for the beneficiary to work. DHS cannot estimate how much time petitioners take to provide that information.

e. Employer-Employee Relationship
DHS will remove from the definition of U.S. employer the reference to an employer-employee relationship requirement, which, in the past, was interpreted using common law principles and was a significant barrier to the H-1B program for certain petitioners, including beneficiary-owned petitioners. This proposed change is consistent with current USCIS policy guidance and will promote clarity and transparency in the regulations. This change will benefit petitioners because it may decrease confusion and increase clarity for stakeholders. Relative to the no-action baseline, this change has no costs associated with it, and there may be transparency benefits due to this change. Relative to the without-policy baseline petitioners may have taken time to understand the change.

xvii. Beneficiary-Owners
DHS codifies a petitioner's ability to qualify as a U.S. employer even when the beneficiary possesses a controlling interest in that petitioner. To promote access to H-1Bs for entrepreneurs, start-up entities, and other beneficiary-owned businesses, DHS will add provisions to specifically address situations where a potential H-1B beneficiary owns a controlling interest in the petitioning entity. If more entrepreneurs are able to obtain H-1B status to develop their business enterprise, the United States could benefit from the creation of jobs, new industries, and new opportunities.[201] 
This change will benefit H-1B petitions filed by start-up entities and other beneficiary-owned businesses, or filed on behalf of entrepreneurs who have a controlling interest in the petitioning entity. DHS is unable to estimate how many petitioners will benefit from this change.

DHS is also providing new guardrails for beneficiary-owned entities, including limiting the validity period for beneficiary-owned entities' initial petition and first extension (including an amended petition with a request for an extension of stay) of such a petition to 18 months. 
See amended 8 CFR 214.2(h)(9)(iii)(E) (https://www.ecfr.gov/current/title-8/chapter-I/subchapter-B/part-214/subpart-A/section-214.2#p-214.2(h)(9)(iii)(E)). Any subsequent extension will not be limited and may be approved for up to 3 years, assuming the petition satisfies all other H-1B requirements. DHS is limiting the first two validity periods to 18 months as a safeguard against possible fraudulent petitions. While DHS sees a significant advantage in promoting the H-1B program to entrepreneurs and allowing these beneficiaries to perform a significant amount of non-specialty occupation duties, unscrupulous petitioners might abuse such provisions without sufficient guardrails. DHS believes that there may be a cost to petitioners associated with this change however cannot estimate how many petitioners may be affected by limiting the validity period. DHS is also finalizing the provision that a beneficiary-owner may perform duties that are directly related to owning and directing the petitioner's business as long as the beneficiary will perform specialty occupation duties a majority of the time, consistent with the terms of the H-1B petition. DHS believes that there may be a cost to petitioners associated with this change however cannot estimate how many petitioners may be affected.

xviii. Site Visits
USCIS conducts inspections, evaluations, verifications, and compliance reviews, to ensure that a petitioner and beneficiary are eligible for the benefit sought and that all laws have been complied with before and after approval of such benefits. These inspections, verifications, and other compliance reviews may be conducted telephonically or electronically, as well as through physical on-site inspections (site visits). DHS is adding regulations specific to the H-1B program to codify its existing authority and clarify the scope of inspections and the consequences of a petitioner's or third party's refusal or failure to fully cooperate with these inspections. Using its general authority, USCIS may conduct audits, on-site inspections, reviews, or investigations to ensure that a petitioner and beneficiary are entitled to the benefits sought and that all laws have been complied with before and after approval of such benefits.[202] 
The authority to conduct on-site inspection is critical to the integrity of the H-1B program to detect and deter fraud and noncompliance.
In July 2009, USCIS started the Administrative Site Visit and Verification Program [203] as an additional method to verify information in certain visa petitions under scrutiny. Under this program, FDNS officers are authorized to make unannounced site visits to collect information as part of a compliance review, which verifies whether petitioners and beneficiaries are following the immigration laws and regulations that are applicable in a particular case. This process includes researching information in government databases, reviewing public records and evidence accompanying the petition, interviewing the petitioner or beneficiary, and conducting site visits. Once the FDNS officers complete the site visit, they write a Compliance Review Report for any indicators of fraud or noncompliance to assist USCIS in final adjudicative decisions.
The site visits conducted under USCIS's existent, general authority, and thus part of the baseline against which this rule's impact should be measured, have uncovered a significant amount of noncompliance in the H-1B program.[204] 
Further, when disaggregated by worksite location, the noncompliance rate was found to be higher for workers placed at an off-site or third-party location compared to workers placed at a petitioner's on-site location.[205] As a result, USCIS began conducting more targeted site visits related to the H-1B program, focusing on the cases of H-1B dependent employers (i.e., employers who have a high ratio of H-1B workers compared to U.S. workers, as defined by statute) for whom USCIS cannot validate the employer's basic business information through commercially available data, and on employers petitioning for H-1B workers who work off-site at another company or organization's location.
DHS believes that site visits are important to maintain the integrity of the H-1B program to detect and deter fraud and noncompliance in the H-1B program, which in turn ensures the appropriate use of the H-1B program and the protection of the interests of U.S. workers. These site visits will continue in the absence of this rule and DHS notes that current Form I-129 instructions notify petitioners of USCIS' legal authority to verify information before or after a case decision, including by means of unannounced physical site inspection. Hence, DHS is adding additional requirements specific to the H-1B program to set forth the scope of on-site inspections, and the consequences of a petitioner's or third party's refusal or failure to fully cooperate with existing inspections. DHS does not foresee the rule leading to more on-site inspections.
This rule will provide a clear disincentive for petitioners that do not cooperate with compliance reviews and inspections while giving USCIS greater authority to access and confirm information about employers and workers as well as identify fraud.
The regulations will make clear that inspections may include, but are not limited to, an on-site visit of the petitioning organization's facilities, interviews with its officials, review of its records related to compliance with immigration laws and regulations, and interviews with any other individuals or review of any other records that USCIS may lawfully obtain and that it considers pertinent to verify facts related to the adjudication of the petition, such as facts relating to the petitioner's and beneficiary's eligibility and continued compliance with the requirements of the H-1B program. 
See amended 8 CFR 214.2(h)(4)(i)(B) (https://www.ecfr.gov/current/title-8/chapter-I/subchapter-B/part-214/subpart-A/section-214.2#p-214.2(h)(4)(i)(B)) (2). The regulation will also clarify that an inspection may take place at the petitioning organization's headquarters, satellite locations, or the location where the beneficiary works or will work, including third-party worksites, as applicable. The provisions will make clear that an H-1B petitioner or any employer must allow access to all sites where the labor will be performed for the purpose of determining compliance with applicable H-1B requirements. The regulation will state the consequences if USCIS is unable to verify facts related to an H-1B petition, including due to the failure or refusal of the petitioner or a third-party worksite to cooperate with a site visit. These failures or refusals may be grounds for denial or revocation of any H-1B petition related to locations that are a subject of inspection, including any third-party worksites. See amended 8 CFR 214.2(h)(4)(i)(B) (https://www.ecfr.gov/current/title-8/chapter-I/subchapter-B/part-214/subpart-A/section-214.2#p-214.2(h)(4)(i)(B)) (2).
In order to estimate the population impacted by site visits, DHS uses site inspection data used to verify facts pertaining to the H-1B petition adjudication process. The site inspections were conducted at H-1B petitioners' on-site locations and third-party worksites during FY 2019 through FY 2023. For instance, from FY 2019 through FY 2023, USCIS conducted a total of 32,366 H-1B compliance reviews and found 6,206 of them, equal to 19 percent, to be noncompliant or indicative of fraud.[206] 
These compliance reviews (from FY 2019 through FY 2023) consisted of reviews conducted under both the Administrative Site Visit and Verification Program and the Targeted Site Visit and Verification Program, which began in 2017. The targeted site visit program allows USCIS to focus resources where fraud and abuse of the H-1B program may be more likely to occur.207
Table 19 shows the number of H-1B worksite inspections conducted each year and the number of visits that resulted in compliance and noncompliance. USCIS found a low of 1,061 fraudulent/noncompliant cases in FY 2022, and a high of 1,473 fraudulent/noncompliant cases in FY 2021. DHS estimates that, on average, USCIS conducted 6,473 H-1B worksite inspections annually from FY 2019 through FY 2023 and of those DHS finds a noncompliance rate of 19 percent. Assuming USCIS continues worksite inspections at the 5-year annual average rate, the population impacted by this provision will be 1,241 or 19 percent of H-1B petitioners visited who are found noncompliant or indicative of fraud. The outcomes of site visits under the rule are indeterminate as currently noncooperative petitioners might be found to be fully compliant, might continue to not cooperate with site visits despite penalties, or might be forced to reveal fraudulent practices to USCIS. The expected increase in cooperation from current levels will be the most important impact of the provision, which DHS discusses below. DHS notes that the increased cooperation might come disproportionately from site visits of third-party worksites that did not sign Form I-129 attesting to permit unannounced physical site inspections of residences and places of employment by USCIS.


xix. Third-Party Placement (Codifying Policy Based on Defensor v. Meissner (5th Cir. 2000))
Amended 8 CFR 214.2(h)(4)(i)(B) (https://www.ecfr.gov/current/title-8/chapter-I/subchapter-B/part-214/subpart-A/section-214.2#p-214.2(h)(4)(i)(B)) (3) clarifies that, in certain circumstances USCIS will look at the third party's requirements for the beneficiary's position, rather than the petitioner's stated requirements, in assessing whether the proffered position qualifies as a specialty occupation.
As required by both INA section 214(i)(1) and 8 CFR 214.2(h)(4)(i)(A) (https://www.ecfr.gov/current/title-8/chapter-I/subchapter-B/part-214/subpart-A/section-214.2#p-214.2(h)(4)(i)(A)) (1), an H-1B petition for a specialty occupation worker must demonstrate that the worker will perform services in a specialty occupation, which requires theoretical and practical application of a body of highly specialized knowledge and attainment of a baccalaureate or higher degree in the specific specialty (or its equivalent) as a minimum requirement for entry into the occupation in the United States. This provision will ensure that petitioners are not circumventing specialty occupation requirements by imposing token requirements or requirements that are not normal to the third party. Specifically, under amended 8 CFR 214.2(h)(4)(i)(B) (https://www.ecfr.gov/current/title-8/chapter-I/subchapter-B/part-214/subpart-A/section-214.2#p-214.2(h)(4)(i)(B)) (3), if the beneficiary will be staffed to a third party, meaning they will be contracted to fill a position in a third party's organization and becomes part of that third party's organizational hierarchy by filling a position in that hierarchy (and not merely providing services to the third party), the actual work to be performed by the beneficiary must be in a specialty occupation. Therefore, it is the requirements of that third party, and not the petitioner, that are most relevant when determining whether the position is a specialty occupation. Relative to the no-action baseline, this change has no costs associated with it, and there may be transparency benefits due to this change. Relative to the without-policy baseline some petitioners for third parties may have taken time to demonstrate that the worker will perform services in a specialty occupation for that third party. Because this has been in place for a long time, DHS cannot estimate how much time it will have taken for petitioners to provide that information.

4. Alternatives Considered
In the NPRM, DHS sought public comment on how to ensure that the limited number of H-1B cap-subject visas, and new H-1B status grants available each fiscal year are used for non-speculative job opportunities. DHS has reviewed public comments, including suggested alternatives, on the various provisions in the NPRM and responded above.

5. Total Quantified Net Costs of the Final Regulatory Changes
In this section, DHS presents the total annual cost savings of this final rule annualized over a 10-year period of analysis. Table 22 details the annual cost savings of this rule. DHS estimates the total cost savings is $1,038,721.


B. Regulatory Flexibility Act
The Regulatory Flexibility Act of 1980 (RFA), 5 U.S.C. 601 (https://www.govinfo.gov/content/pkg/USCODE-2023-title5/pdf/USCODE-2023-title5-partI-chap6-sec601.pdf) and 602 (https://www.govinfo.gov/content/pkg/USCODE-2023-title5/pdf/USCODE-2023-title5-partI-chap6-sec602.pdf), as amended by the Small Business Regulatory Enforcement Fairness Act of 1996, Public Law 104-121 (https://www.govinfo.gov/content/pkg/PLAW-104publ121/pdf/PLAW-104publ121.pdf), requires Federal agencies to consider the potential impact of regulations on small businesses, small governmental jurisdictions, and small organizations during the development of their rules. The term “small entities” comprises small businesses, not-for-profit organizations that are independently owned and operated and are not dominant in their fields, and governmental jurisdictions with populations of less than 50,000.[215] 
An “individual” is not considered a small entity and costs to an individual are not considered a small entity impact for RFA purposes. In addition, the courts have held that the RFA requires an agency to perform a regulatory flexibility analysis of small entity impacts only when a rule directly regulates small entities.[216] 
Consequently, indirect impacts from a rule on a small entity are not considered as costs for RFA purposes. USCIS acknowledges that the rule could have indirect impacts on small entities including, but not limited to, costs associated with the time required to comply with the site visits provision. These indirect impacts are not included within the RFA because of uncertainty related to how many small entities would be affected and the degree to which affected entities would be impacted. The Regulatory Impact Analysis included above contains in-depth analysis of those possible impacts and how they may impact small entities.
USCIS's RFA analysis for this final rule focuses on the population of Form I-129 petitions for H-1B workers.


C. Final Regulatory Flexibility Act (FRFA)
6. A Statement of the Need for, and Objectives of, the Rule
The purpose of this rulemaking is to modernize and improve the regulations relating to the H-1B program by: (1) streamlining the requirements of the H-1B program and improving program efficiency; (2) providing greater benefits and flexibility for petitioners and beneficiaries; and (3) improving integrity measures.

7. A Statement of the Significant Issues Raised by the Public Comments in Response to the IRFA, a Statement of the Assessment of the Agency of Such Issues, and a Statement of any Changes Made in the Proposed Rule as a Result of Such Comments
DHS invited comments in the NPRM but did not receive any comments specific to the IRFA. USCIS responded to general comments concerning the rule in section III (Public Comments on the Proposed Rule).

8. The Response of the Agency to Any Comments Filed by the Chief Counsel for Advocacy of the Small Business Administration in Response to the Proposed Rule, and a Detailed Statement of Any Change Made to the Proposed Rule in the Final Rule as a Result of the Comments
DHS invited comments in the NPRM but did not receive any comments filed by the Chief Counsel for Advocacy of the Small Business Administration.

9. A Description and an Estimate of the Number of Small Entities to Which the Rule Will Apply or an Explanation of Why No Such Estimate Is Available
For this analysis, due to the impracticality of full population analysis, DHS conducted a sample analysis of historical Form I-129 H-1B petitions to estimate the number of small entities impacted by this rule. DHS utilized a subscription-based electronic database of U.S. entities, ReferenceUSA, as well as three other open-access, free databases of public and private entities, Manta, Cortera, and Guidestar to determine the North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code, revenue, and employee count for each entity. To determine whether an entity is small for purposes of RFA, DHS first classified the entity by its NAICS code and then used Small Business Administration (SBA) guidelines to classify the revenue or employee count threshold for each entity. Some entities were classified as small based on their annual revenue, and some by their numbers of employees.
Using FY 2022 internal data on actual filings of Form I-129 H-1B petitions, DHS identified 44,593 unique entities. DHS devised a methodology to conduct the small entity analysis based on a representative, random sample of the potentially impacted population. DHS first determined the minimum sample size necessary to achieve a 95-percent confidence level confidence interval estimation for the impacted population of entities using the standard statistical formula at a 5-percent margin of error. DHS then created a sample size greater than the minimum necessary to increase the likelihood that our matches would meet or exceed the minimum required sample. DHS notes that the random sample was drawn from the population of Form I-129 H-1B petitioners for purposes of estimating impacts of each provision in the NPRM, including those finalized here, on the population of Form I-129 H-1B petitioners at-large.
DHS randomly selected a sample of 3,396 entities from the population of 44,593 entities that filed Form I-129 for H-1B petitions in FY 2022. Of the 3,396 entities, 1,724 entities returned a successful match of a filing entity in the ReferenceUSA, Manta, Cortera, and Guidestar databases; 1,672 entities did not return a match. Using these databases' revenue or employee count and their assigned NAICS code, DHS determined 1,209 of the 1,724 matches to be small entities, 515 to be non-small entities. DHS assumes filing entities without database matches or missing revenue/employee count data are likely to be small entities. As a result, in order to prevent underestimating the number of small entities this final rule will affect, DHS considers all the non-matched and missing entities as small entities for the purpose of this analysis. Therefore, DHS classifies 2,881 of 3,396 entities as small entities, including combined non-matches (1,672), and small entity matches (1,209). Thus, DHS estimates that 84.8 percent (2,881 of 3,396) of the entities filing Form I-129 H-1B petitions are small entities.
In this analysis DHS assumes that the distribution of firm size for our sample is the same as the entire population of Form I-129 H-1B petitioners. Thus, DHS estimates the number of small entities to be 84.8 percent of the population of 44,593 entities that filed Form I-129 under the H-1B classification, as summarized in Table 25 below. The annual numeric estimate of the small entities impacted by this final rule is 37,815 entities.[217]
Following the distributional assumptions above, DHS uses the set of 1,209 small entities with matched revenue data to estimate the economic impact of the final rule on each small entity. Typically, DHS will estimate the economic impact, in percentage, for each small entity is the sum of the impacts of the final changes divided by the entity's sales revenue.[218] 
DHS constructed the distribution of economic impact of the final rule based on the 1,209 small entity matches in the sample. Because this final rule resulted in an overall cost savings for petitioners there also would be no adverse impact on the estimated small entity population. Based on FY 2022 revenue, of the 1,209 small entities, 0 percent (0 small entities) would experience a cost increase that is greater than 1 percent of revenues.


10. A Description of the Projected Reporting, Recordkeeping, and Other Compliance Requirements of the Rule, Including an Estimate of the Classes of Small Entities That Will be Subject to the Requirement and the Types of Professional Skills Necessary for Preparation of the Report or Record
This rule codifies USCIS' existing authority to conduct site visits and clarify the scope of inspections and the consequences of a petitioner's or third party's refusal or failure to fully cooperate with these inspections, and supervisors of H-1B beneficiaries will bear an opportunity cost of time as described above.


11. A Description of the Steps the Agency has Taken To Minimize the Significant Economic Impact on Small Entities Consistent With the Stated Objectives of Applicable Statutes, Including a Statement of the Factual, Policy, and Legal Reasons for Selecting the Alternative Adopted in the Final Rule and why Each of the Other Significant Alternatives to the Rule Considered by the Agency was Rejected
While the site visit provision imposes some burden to prospective employers, USCIS found no other alternatives that achieved stated objectives with less burden to small entities.

D. Unfunded Mandates Reform Act of 1995 (UMRA)
The Unfunded Mandates Reform Act of 1995 (UMRA) is intended, among other things, to curb the practice of imposing unfunded Federal mandates on State, local, and Tribal governments. Title II of UMRA requires each Federal agency to prepare a written statement assessing the effects of any Federal mandate in a proposed rule, or final rule for which the agency published a proposed rule, that includes any Federal mandate that may result in a $100 million or more expenditure (adjusted annually for inflation) in any one year by State, local, and Tribal governments, in the aggregate, or by the private sector.[219]
The inflation adjusted value of $100 million in 1995 is approximately $200 million in 2023 based on the Consumer Price Index for All Urban Consumers (CPI-U).[220] 
This final rule does not contain a Federal mandate as the term is defined under UMRA.[221] 
The requirements of title II of UMRA, therefore, do not apply, and DHS has not prepared a statement under UMRA.

 Congress did not define the terms “nonprofit research organization” and “governmental research organization” in INA sec. 214(g)(5), 8 U.S.C. 1184(g)(5). Because Congress did not define these terms and has delegated discretionary authority to DHS, DHS may reasonably define the terms consistent with their ordinary meanings and the overall statutory scheme. 
See Loper Bright Enterprises
v. 
Raimondo,
144 S. Ct. 2244, 2263 (2024) (explaining that a statute's meaning may be that the agency is authorized to exercise a degree of discretion and empowered to prescribe rules to fill in statutory gaps based on “reasoned decision making.”). In addition, DHS has express delegated authority to administer the immigration laws and issue regulations pursuant to INA section 103(a), 8 U.S.C. 1103(a), and to issue regulations pertaining to the admission of nonimmigrants, and set conditions for nonimmigrant petitions pursuant to INA section 214(a) and (c), respectively, 8 U.S.C. 1184(a) and (c).

 DHS recognizes that the definition of “nonprofit research organization or government research organization” at new 8 CFR 214.2(h)(19)(iii)(C) differs from DOL's definition of “nonprofit research organization or governmental research organization” at 20 CFR 656.40(e)(1)(iii). However, DHS definitions are separate from, and generally serve different purposes than, DOL definitions. Specifically, the DHS definition of “nonprofit research organization or government research organization” at new 8 CFR 214.2(h)(19)(iii)(C) is used to determine whether an H-1B petitioner is exempt from the H-1B cap under INA 214(g)(5)(B), 8 U.S.C. 1184(g)(5)(B), and from paying the ACWIA fee under INA 214(c)(9)(A), 8 U.S.C. 1184(c)(9)(A). In contrast, the DOL definition of “nonprofit research organization or government research organization” at 20 CFR 656.40(e) is used for prevailing wage determinations under INA 212(p)(1)(B), 8 U.S.C. 1182(p)(1)(B). 
See also20 CFR 655.731(a)(2)(vii) (cross-referencing definition at 20 CFR 656.40(e) for purposes of H-1B LCAs).

See80 FR 81900, 81919 (Dec. 31, 2015) (proposing to conform DHS regulations to the then-existing policy pertaining to the definitions of several terms in INA section 214(g)(5) and the applicability of those terms to the ACWIA fee exemption provisions and the AC21 cap exemption provisions). The cross reference between the provisions was codified in the final rule. 
See81 FR 82398, 82486 (Nov. 18, 2016). The provision codified at 8 CFR 214.2(h)(8)(ii)(F) was subsequently redesignated as 8 CFR 214.2(h)(8)(iii)(F). 
See84 FR 888, 954 (Jan. 31, 2019). Note, however, that the policy of extending the definitions from the ACWIA fee context to the H-1B cap exemption context predates the codification of that policy.

 Although the commenter referenced 20 CFR 755.715, DHS assumes the intended citation is to 20 CFR 655.715 which defines “employer” as “a person, firm, corporation, contractor, or other association or organization in the United States that has an employment relationship with H-1B, H-1B1, or E-3 nonimmigrants and/or U.S. worker(s). In the case of an H-1B nonimmigrant (not including E-3 and H-1B1 nonimmigrants), the person, firm, contractor, or other association or organization in the United States that files a petition with the United States Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) of the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) on behalf of the nonimmigrant is deemed to be the employer of that nonimmigrant.”


140.
 This provision does not preclude USCIS from requesting contracts for other reasons, such as to establish eligibility of agents as petitioners, and maintenance of status. See 8 CFR 214.2(h)(2)(i)(F) (“An agent performing the function of an employer must guarantee the wages and other terms and conditions of employment by contractual agreement with the beneficiary or beneficiaries of the petition.”); new 8 CFR 214.1(c)(6) (“Evidence of such maintenance of status may include, but is not limited to: copies of paystubs, W-2 forms, quarterly wage reports, tax returns, contracts, and work orders.”).

Average duration of interview hours for Supervisors or  managers (0.545) = Average inspection duration (1.09) × 50% = 0.545.

The economic impact, in percentage, for each small entity = ((Cost of one petition for entity × Number of petitions for entity i)/Entity i's sales revenue) × 100. The cost of one petition for entity  i (−$0.79) is estimated by dividing the total cost of this rule by the estimated population. −$333,835/421,421 = −$0.79. The entity's sales revenue is taken from ReferenceUSA, Manta, Cortera, and Guidestar databases.

(last visited Jan. 17, 2024). Calculation of inflation: (1) Calculate the average monthly CPI-U for the reference year (1995) and the current year (2023); (2) Subtract reference year CPI-U from current year CPI-U; (3) Divide the difference of the reference year CPI-U and current year CPI-U by the reference year CPI-U; (4) Multiply by 100 = [(Average monthly CPI-U for 2023-Average monthly CPI-U for 1995) ÷ (Average monthly CPI-U for 1995)]×100 = [(304.702-152.383) ÷152.383] = (152.319/152.383) = 0.99958001×100 = 99.96 percent = 100 percent (rounded). Calculation of inflation-adjusted value: $100 million in 1995 dollars×2.00 = $200 million in 2023 dollars.

After the publication of the NPRM, DHS published the USCIS Fee Schedule Final Rule (“Fee Rule”) (89 FR 6194) on January 31, 2024, and that rule went into effect on April 1, 2024. Subsequently, DHS updated the information collection, and the baseline estimated total number of respondents, and the amount of time estimated for an average respondent to respond, to reflect the changes to the information collection approved in connection with the Fee Rule. As a result, the estimated total public burden in hours and cost associated with the information collection has changed since the publication of the NPRM. USCIS Form I-129 (paper-filings) estimated time burden average per response is 2.487 hours (current) + .067 hours (increase from the NPRM) = 2.55 hours. On April 1, 2024, DHS also began accepting online filing for H-1B cap petitions and since included the estimated total respondents and the estimated time burden average per response to account for electronic filing submissions since the publication of the NPRM.
