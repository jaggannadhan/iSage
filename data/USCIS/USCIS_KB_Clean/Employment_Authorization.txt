Employment Authorization
U.S. employers must check to make sure all employees, regardless of citizenship or national origin, are allowed to work in the United States. If you are not a citizen or a lawful permanent resident, you may need to prove that you can work in the United States by presenting an Employment Authorization Document (Form I-766/EAD) (https://www.uscis.gov/employment-authorization#). You may apply for an EAD if you are eligible.

USCIS issues the following types of EADs:
1. Initial EAD: This document proves you are allowed to work in the United States.
2. Renewal EAD: This document renews your initial EAD. Generally, you should not file for a renewal EAD more than 180 days before your original EAD expires.
3. Replacement EAD: This document replaces a lost, stolen, or mutilated EAD. A replacement EAD also replaces an EAD that was issued with incorrect information, such as a misspelled name.

Note: In addition, certain B-1 nonimmigrant visitors are issued EADs.
